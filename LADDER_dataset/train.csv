Using the device accelerometer sensor it implements a simple pedometer that is used to measure movements of the victim.	1
When the malware is first started on the device it will begin by hiding its icon from the application drawer.	1
Then it will ask for the accessibility service privilege as visible in the following screenshot:	1
After the user grants the requested privilege, Cerberus starts to abuse it by granting itself additional permissions, such as permissions needed to send messages and make calls, without requiring any user interaction.	1
It also disables Play Protect (Google’s preinstalled antivirus solution) to prevent its discovery and deletion in the future.	1
After conveniently granting itself additional privileges and securing its persistence on the device, Cerberus registers the infected device in the botnet and waits for commands from the C2 server while also being ready to perform overlay attacks.	1

Most Android banking Trojans use overlay attacks to trick the victim into providing their personal information (such as but not limited to: credit card information, banking credentials, mail credentials) and Cerberus is no exception.	1
In this particular case, the bot abuses the accessibility service privilege to obtain the package name of the foreground application and determine whether or not to show a phishing overlay window, as shown in the following code snippet:	1
Ursnif Leverages Cerberus to Automate Fraudulent Bank Transfers in Italy	1
Aside from the Ursnif infection on the victim’s desktop, the malware tricks victims into fetching a mobile app from a fake Google Play page and infects their mobile device with the Cerberus Android malware.	1
The Cerberus malware component of the attack is used by Ursnif’s operators to receive two-factor authentication codes sent by banks to their users when account updates and money transfer transactions are being confirmed in real-time.	1
Cerberus also possesses other features and can enable the attacker to obtain the lock-screen code and remotely control the device.	1
It has evolved over time to eventually feature the ability to hijack SMS content and control devices remotely, alongside other sophisticated data theft features.	1
If users scan the QR code, they will open a web page on their smartphone and be sent to a fake Google Play page featuring a corresponding banking app logo of the banking brand the victim originally attempted to access.	1
If the victims submit their phone number on the web injection, the remote server will send back a download URL for them to unknowingly download the Cerberus malware.	1
Cerberus is being used here only as the component that allows the attackers to bypass the bank’s SMS-code verification challenge.	1
ADD_INFO Send data to C2: token, SMS content, telephone, download an application.	1
ASK Send communication to the C2.	1
GET_DROP Check account balance on the victim’s bank account.	1
GOOD_TRF Attempt to initiate a money transfer transaction.	1
LOGIN Send victim’s login information to attacker’s C2 server.	1
PING Check if the infected machine is currently online.	1
Since it hooks the internet browser, it takes different steps to manipulate what victims see on their screens and have them click on elements that launch the Trojan’s resources into action.	1
It, therefore, attempts to replace a login button from the original bank’s webpage and plant its own button that the victim will click.	1
After receiving the data from the victim, the malware sends data to the C2 server, including authorization token, SMS content, telephone number and account login information.	1
To prevent victims from accessing the account and discovering the fraudulent activity before it is finalized, Ursnif presents a maintenance notice on the account.	1
In-depth analysis of the infrastructure has already unearthed the malware’s ability to covertly send and steal SMS codes, to open tailored overlays for various online banks, and to steal 2FA-codes including from Google Authenticator.	1
Additional capabilities include accessing customer credit card and contact details, the ability to redirect calls or tamper with mobile functionality via its RAT features, and to automatically grant required permissions as part of its authentication attributes.	1
Like any Remote Access Trojan worth its salt, Cerberus is capable of deep surveillance within your device, interfering with the encrypted communications the phone has with its apps, and outside.	1
Basically, Cerberus can intercept and steal your phone’s unlock pattern or PIN, as well as Google Authenticator numbers, and any SMS necessary to perform a two-step verification.	1
Likewise, this malware can interpose itself between you and your bank’s app through an overlay, the most common method for carrying out a phishing attack.	1
In short, Cerberus can enter your computer, extract all the necessary data to perform a bank fraud, and wait for the best moment to take the money from your account.	1
This service, which normally assists users with disabilities in certain applications, is abused by Cerberus to give itself more permissions without user interaction.	1
Having control of the Accessibility Services, the malware proceeds to ensure its persistence in different ways, either by disabling Play Protect or by removing itself from the applications in use.	1
On the other hand, Cerberus is capable of generating an instance of TeamViewer on mobile, and through the aforementioned Accessibility permissions, authorizing said session while the equipment is in use, all without user interaction.	1

Various protection capabilities, such as emulation detection	1
It is also capable of running its own TeamViewer instance, and of displaying fake logins for more than 226 applications.	1
ERMAC differs from Cerberus in the usage of different obfuscation techniques and Blowfish encryption algorithm.	1
“Compared to the original Cerberus, ERMAC uses different encryption scheme in communication with the C2: the data is encrypted with AES-128-CBC, and prepended with double word containing the length of the encoded data”	1
The new banking Trojan supports the same latest Cerberus commands, except for a couple of commands that allow to clear the content of the cache of the specified application and steal device accounts.	1
clearCash/clearCashe Triggers opening specified application details	1
getAccounts/logAccounts Triggers stealing a list of the accounts on the device	1
"Dubbed ""Cerberus,"" the new remote access Trojan allows remote attackers to take total control over the infected Android devices and also comes with banking Trojan capabilities like the use of overlay attacks, SMS control, and contact list harvesting."	1

Once infected, Cerberus first hides its icon from the application drawer and then asks for the accessibility permission by masquerading itself as Flash Player Service.	1
If granted, the malware automatically registers the compromised device to its command-and-control server, allowing the buyer/attacker to control the device remotely.	1
To steal users' credit card numbers, banking credentials and passwords for other online accounts, Cerberus lets attackers launch screen overlay attacks from its remote dashboard.	1
In screen overlay attack, the Trojan displays an overlay on top of legitimate mobile banking apps and tricks Android users into entering their banking credentials into the fake login screen, just like a phishing attack.	1
Cerberus Uses Motion-based Evasion Tactic	1
Cerberus also uses some interesting techniques to evade detection from antivirus solutions and prevent its analysis, like using the device accelerometer sensor to measure movements of the victim.	1
The malware monitors the user's steps through the device motion sensor to check if it is running on a real Android device.	1
The Cerberus malware can steal banking credentials, bypass security measures and access text messages.	1
Once executed, the malware has the capabilities to steal victims’ bank-account credentials and bypass security measures, including two-factor authentication (2FA).	1
“As is common with banking malware, Cerberus disguised itself as a genuine app in order to access the banking details of unsuspecting users,” Ondrej David, with Avast, said in a Tuesday analysis.	1
Cerberus has various spying and credential-theft functionalities.	1
It can sit over an existing banking app and wait for the user to log into their bank account.	1
Then, it creates a layover over the victims’ login screen, and steals their banking credentials.	1
In addition, the trojan has the ability to access victims’ text messages, meaning that it can view two-factor authentication (2FA) codes sent via message.	1
“It uses Android’s accessibility function, as well as the overlay attack mechanism, which is typical for banking trojans, so when a user opens their regular banking app, an overlay screen is created, and the user’s login details collected,” David told Threatpost.	1
Since then a newly discovered variant of the Cerberus Android trojan has been spotted, with vastly expanded and more sophisticated info-harvesting capabilities, and the ability to run TeamViewer.	1
In February, researchers identified eight malicious Android apps on Google Play distributing the “Haken” malware, which exfiltrates sensitive data from victims and covertly signs them up for expensive premium subscription services.	1
The newly uncovered banking Alien trojan is ‘invading’ Android devices worldwide, using an advanced ability to bypass 2-factor authentication (2FA) security measures to steal victim credentials!	1
When it has infected a device, the RAT tries to take passwords from at least 226 mobile applications; including banking apps like Bank of America Mobile Banking & Capital One Mobile, as well as many collaboration & social apps e.g.	1
The Alien RAT has various commonly used Android malware capabilities, including the ability to launch overlay attacks, control and steal SMS messages & harvest contact lists – as well as keylogging, location-collecting & other capabilities.	1
However, it also deploys several more advanced techniques, including a notification sniffer that allows it to access all new updates on infected devices.	1
This includes 2FA codes, which allow the malware to bypass 2FA security measures.	1
Alien uses this tactic by abusing the:- “android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE” to get the content of status bar notifications on the infected device.	1
While the user would need to grant this permission manually in the settings, the malware overcomes this block by using the Accessibility privileges on Android devices, performing all necessary user interactions all by itself.	1
It does this using an advanced remote access feature that compromises the TeamViewer application, giving the bad player behind the malware remote control over the victim’s devices.	1
“When TeamViewer is successfully activated, it provides the actors with full remote control of the device’s user interface, enabling them to access & change device settings, install & remove apps, but also to use any app installed on the device (bank applications, messengers & social networks),” outlined researchers.	1
The big difference between the 2 types is Alien’s 2FA-stealing technique, a feature that Cerberus lacked, they commented.	1
In circulation since at least July 2019, the Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is able to conduct covert surveillance, intercept communication, tamper with device functionality, and steal data including banking credentials by creating overlays on existing banking, retail, and social networking apps.	1
The malware is able to read text messages that may contain one-time passcodes (OTP) and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, thereby bypassing typical 2FA account protections.	1
In this blog, we describe a relatively new and barely known Android banking Trojan with Remote Access Trojan, notification stealing and authenticator-based 2FA theft capabilities, dubbed Alien, and explain how it relates to infamous Cerberus malware, who’s service has recently been discontinued.	1
This discovery also matched the fact that the newly found samples included the RAT feature, making use of TeamViewer to provide remote access to the infected device.	1
Interestingly enough, this speculation is corroborated by the fact that when the second version of Cerberus (v2) was released in May 2020, it did not introduce any major new features, except for the one to steal 2FA codes from Google’s authenticator app.	1
It has common capabilities such as overlay attacks, control and steal SMS messages and harvest the contact list.	1
It can leverage its keylogger for any use and therefore broaden the attack scope further than its target list.	1
It also offers the possibility to install, start and remove applications from the infected device.	1
Most importantly, it offers a notifications sniffer, allowing it to get the content of all notifications on the infected device, and a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) feature (by abusing the TeamViewer application), meaning that the threat actors can perform the fraud from the victim’s device.	1
Remote access	1
Based on the same code, the two Trojans share most functionalities, but the Alien authors added two major features that are absent from both versions of Cerberus, respectively TeamViewer based remote control of the infected device and the notification sniffer (stealer).	1
rat_disconnect Disables the RAT service	1
open_folder Lists files and subfolders in the specified folder	1
uploadind_file Uploads the specified file to the C2	1
connect_teamviewer Provides credentials for the TeamViewer app and launches it	1
open_team_viewer Launches the TeamViewer app	1
send_settings Sends the current settings of RAT service to the C2	1
get_apps Gets the list of installed applications on the infected device	1
Once the actor provides the credentials to set up the TeamViewer server connection, the Trojan uses the Accessibility privileges to access the TeamViewer application, logs in using the provided credentials, grant any additional permissions it requires to run and dismiss any warnings issued (if applicable).	1
When TeamViewer is successfully activated, it provides the actors with full remote control of the device’s user interface, enabling them to access and change device settings, install and remove apps, but also to use any app installed on the device (bank applications, messengers and social networks).	1
In the case of Alien, advanced features such as the authenticator-code stealer and notifications-sniffer aside, the features of the Trojan are quite common.	1
Millions of Android users are being warned about a devious new banking trojan, dubbed Cerberus, that infects devices by masquerading as an Adobe Flash Player installation.	1
Once installed, the fake download requests accessibility permissions that allow an attack to take place.	1
The malware overlays login screens for banking apps, stealing credentials for its operators.	1
Cerberus also has a crafty evasion technique—using the accelerometer on an infected device to ensure the target is real and not a desk-based security analyst.	1
Cerberus infects users when they access a fake website which immediately requests a download of Adobe Flash Player.	1
Cerberus has been designed to steal banking credentials.	1
It does this—again not unusually—by creating overlays on top of banking apps that capture usernames and passwords as they are being entered.	1
"Cerberus was spread via a fake website that asked users to install Adobe Flash Player."""	1
The malware can then grant itself additional rights to control the device, send messages, make calls, communicate back to its handlers.	1
And so the clever stuff—Cerberus has been designed to avoid detection from desk-based malware analysts by delaying activation until it can confirm the device belongs to a genuine victim.	1
It can harvest contacts, send messages, steal credentials.	1
Cerberus Android Malware Gains Ability to Steal 2FA Tokens, Screen Lock Credentials	1
The Cerberus Android malware family has gained the ability to steal its victims’ two-factor authentication (2FA) tokens and screen lock credentials.	1
This version came with a new remote-access Trojan (RAT) capability that allowed Cerberus to traverse the file system and download its contents.	1
It also enabled the malware to launch TeamViewer and establish connections to it.	1
As such, they could leverage that functionality to change the device’s settings, install or remove any app, use an app, and conduct espionage on the device’s activity.	1
Attackers could also abuse the Accessibility features to steal 2FA codes from the Google Authentication app for the purpose of bypassing authentication services.	1
This trojan uses peoples’ worry of COVID-19 to steal financial data such as credit card numbers.	1
It also uses overlay attacks to trick victims into providing personal information and can capture two-factor authentication details.	1
They are usually spread via phishing campaigns.	1
Corona-Apps.apk uses its connection with the actual virus name to trick users into installing it on their smartphones.	1
Why would such an app want to send and receive text messages, record audio, and read the user’s contact list?	1
DroidJack RAT starts capturing sensitive information like call data, SMS data, videos, photos, etc.	1
Observe below the code routine for call recording.	1
This RAT records all the calls and stores the recording to an “.amr” file.	1
The following is the code routine for video capturing.	1
Here, the RAT stores all the captured videos in a “video.3gp” file.	1
It also harvests call details and SMS logs as shown below.	1
Upon further inspection, we have observed that this RAT extracts WhatsApp data too.	1
The RAT stores all the data in a database (DB) in order to send it to the Command & Control (C&C) server.	1
If you’re a jealous partner, or thinking of stalking someone’s activity and movements, then DroidJack could be just the ticket – as it allows you to take remote control of someone else’s Android device without them noticing, recording private conversations, reading emails, browser history and text messages, as well as tracking their physical location.	1
Of course, just because it is technically possible to do something doesn’t mean that you should do it, and you shouldn’t be swayed by an online store trying to lure you into snooping on other people’s phones and private communications.	1
In this particular attack campaign, DroidJack was spread via SMS messages sent through the OTT carrier to unsuspecting subscribers of its services.	1
"The malicious message contains links to an APK file and users were tricked into clicking the link with the lure of a ""new MMS"" waiting for them to view."	1
In addition to the OTT attack channel, DroidJack was also found by researchers with Proofpoint to have been spread last month by a side load attack through a backdoored version of the Android Pokemon Go app.	1
Case in point, at least one of those unofficial APKs comes modified with DroidJack, a remote access tool which like other mobile trojans gives an attacker full control over an infected device.	1
Proofpoint’s security team describes that the malicious app’s start screen appears identical to that of the legitimate application, which makes it difficult for users to discern whether they’ve been infected with malware.	1
They should first review the permissions requested, as only the malicious version containing DroidJack requests the ability to modify SMS messages and record audio.	1
Such tools allow the administrators of large computer networks to obtain access to individual devices from a remote location.	1
Once DroidJack is on a device, it provides the hacker with an almost universal overview of the device user's data and personal information.	1
Hackers can track the user's GPS coordinates, read SMS messages, listen to phone calls, delete contacts, and even activate and record from the device's mic.	1
Sanjeevi says that the app asks for the user's permission before gaining access to their messages and other information.	1
They prefer cyber-RATs, cyber-crime tools that provide backdoor functionality and access to people’s mobile devices.	1
Like other RATs, this detection allows a remote attacker to control the infected device with a user-friendly control panel – monitor and make phone calls and send SMS messages, get the device’s GPS coordinates, activate and use the camera and microphone and access files on the device.	1
Since the malicious program was detected in 2014, its main functions and propagation method have not changed: Rotexy spreads via links sent in phishing SMSs that prompt the user to install an app.	1
As it launches, it requests device administrator rights, and then starts communicating with its C&C server.	1
Until mid-2015, Rotexy used a plain-text JSON format to communicate with its C&C.	1
In some versions, a dynamically generated low-level domain was used as an address:	1
In its first communication, the Trojan sent the infected device’s IMEI to the C&C, and in return it received a set of rules for processing incoming SMSs (phone numbers, keywords and regular expressions) – these applied mainly to messages from banks, payment systems and mobile network operators.	1
For instance, the Trojan could automatically reply to an SMS and immediately delete it.	1
Rotexy then sent information about the smartphone to the C&C, including the phone model, number, name of the mobile network operator, versions of the operating system and IMEI.	1
Starting from mid-2015, the Trojan began using the AES algorithm to encrypt data communicated between the infected device and the C&C:	1
The page was designed to steal users’ bank card details:	1
At this time, the Trojan also began actively using different methods of obfuscation.	1
When launching for the first time, the Trojan checks if it is being launched in an emulation environment, and in which country it is being launched.	1
If the check is successful, Rotexy registers with GCM and launches SuperService which tracks if the Trojan has device administrator privileges.	1
SuperService also tracks its own status and relaunches if stopped.	1
It performs a privilege check once every second; if unavailable, the Trojan starts requesting them from the user in an infinite loop:	1
If the user agrees and gives the application the requested privileges, another stub page is displayed, and the app hides its icon:	1
If the Trojan detects an attempt to revoke its administrator privileges, it starts periodically switching off the phone screen, trying to stop the user actions.	1
If the privileges are revoked successfully, the Trojan relaunches the cycle of requesting administrator privileges.	1
If, for some reason, SuperService does not switch off the screen when there is an attempt to revoke the device administrator privileges, the Trojan tries to intimidate the user:	1
The relative address to which the Trojan will send information from the device is generated in a pseudo-random manner.	1
Depending on the Trojan version, dynamically generated subdomains can also be used.	1
The Trojan stores information about C&C servers and the data harvested from the infected device in a local SQLite database.	1
First off, the Trojan registers in the administration panel and receives the information it needs to operate from the C&C (the SMS interception templates and the text that will be displayed on HTML pages):	1
Rotexy intercepts all incoming SMSs and processes them according to the templates it received from the C&C.	1
Also, when an SMS arrives, the Trojan puts the phone into silent mode and switches off the screen so the user doesn’t notice that a new SMS has arrived.	1
When required, the Trojan sends an SMS to the specified phone number with the information it has received from the intercepted message.	1
If the application hasn’t received instructions about the rules for processing incoming SMSs, it simply saves all SMSs to a local database and uploads them to the C&C.	1
Apart from general information about the device, the Trojan sends a list of all the running processes and installed applications to the C&C.	1
START, STOP, RESTART — start, stop, restart SuperService.	1
URL — update C&C address.	1
MESSAGE – send SMS containing specified text to a specified number.	1
UPDATE_PATTERNS – reregister in the administration panel.	1
UNBLOCK – unblock the telephone (revoke device administrator privileges from the app).	1
UPDATE – download APK file from C&C and install it.	1
CONTACTS – send text received from C&C to all user contacts.	1
CONTACTS_PRO – request unique message text for contacts from the address book.	1
PAGE – contact URL received from C&C using User-Agent value that was also received from C&C or local database.	1
ALLMSG – send C&C all SMSs received and sent by user, as stored in phone memory.	1
ALLCONTACTS – send all contacts from phone memory to C&C.	1
ONLINE – send information about Trojan’s current status to C&C: whether it has device administrator privileges, which HTML page is currently displayed, whether screen is on or off, etc.	1
NEWMSG – write an SMS to the device memory containing the text and sender number sent from C&C.	1
BLOCKER_BANKING_START – display phishing HTML page for entry of bank card details.	1
BLOCKER_EXTORTIONIST_START – display HTML page of the ransomware.	1
BLOCKER_UPDATE_START – display fake HTML page for update.	1
BLOCKER_STOP – block display of all HTML pages.	1
The Trojan intercepts incoming SMSs and can receive the following commands from them:	1
“3458” — revoke device administrator privileges from the app;	1
“hi”, “ask” — enable and disable mobile internet;	1
“privet”, “ru” — enable and disable Wi-Fi;	1
“check” — send text “install: [device IMEI]” to phone number from which SMS was sent;	1
“stop_blocker” — stop displaying all blocking HTML pages;	1
“393838” — change C&C address to that specified in the SMS.	1
The Trojan displays a fake HTML update page (update.html) that blocks the device’s screen for a long period of time.	1
The Trojan displays the extortion page (extortionist.html) that blocks the device and demands a ransom for unblocking it.	1
The Trojan displays a phishing page (bank.html) prompting the user to enter their bank card details.	1
This page mimics a legitimate bank form and blocks the device screen until the user enters all the information.	1
The following scenario may play out: according to the templates for processing incoming SMSs, Rotexy intercepts a message from the bank that contains the last four digits of the bank card connected to the phone number.	1
The Trojan sends these digits to the C&C, which in turn sends a command to display a fake data entry window to check the four digits.	1
Rotexy may start requesting device administrator privileges again in an infinite loop; in that case, restart the device in safe mode and remove the malicious program.	1
Rotexy spreads through SMS containing links to app download and some catchy texts that prompt people to click those links and download the app.	1
First, Rotexy checks to see what device it has landed on.	1
First by requesting administrator rights.	1
Having got its wicked way, Rotexy reports that the app failed to load and hides its icon.	1
After this, the malware makes contact with its owners, giving them information about the device.	1
By default, Rotexy communicates directly with the C&C server, but its creators implemented other ways to send orders via Google Cloud Messaging and SMS.	1
When a message arrives on an infected phone, the malware switches the gadget into silent mode so that the victim does not notice new incoming SMS.	1
The Trojan then intercepts the message, checks it against the templates received from the C&C server, and if it contains anything juicy (for example, the last digits of a card number in a mobile banking SMS notification), stores and forwards it to the server.	1
If for some reason no templates or special instructions were received from the C&C server, Rotexy simply saves all correspondence on the infected smartphone, and then forwards it to its masters.	1
On top of that, on the cybercriminals’ command, the malware can send a link to download itself to all contacts in the phone book — which is one of the main vectors of propagation for Rotexy Trojan.	1
To do so, it overlays a phishing page on the screen with text received along with the SMS interception instructions.	1
Next, Rotexy extracts the last four digits of the card number from the intercepted banking SMS and matches them against the ones entered on the phishing page.	1
Instead of displaying a phishing page, it blocks the smartphone screen with a menacing window demanding payment of a fine for “regular viewing of prohibited videos.”	1
Google Cloud Messaging Service – to send a small message in JSON format to the android device	1
SMS monitoring or tracking	1
In the first version of Rotexy Trojan (Malware), it spreads via a link sent in Phishing SMS that prompt the user to install an application.	1
When installing the application it asked for the device administrator rights and then start communicating to C&C server.	1
In the next version of Rotexy Trojan Malware, it starts using plain text JSON format to communicate C&C server.	1
Then in the next version of Rotexy trojan malware in 2015-2016, it starts using the AES algorithm to encrypt the data between the user’s device and C&C server.	1
Later, its start using the various method of obfuscation like DEX file is packed with garbage string, AND/OR operations and containing a key to decipher main executable file from APK.	1
Now today, when these applications get downloaded and start the installation, it checks if it is being launched in an emulation or sandbox environment.	1
Then Rotexy Trojan Malware registers with google cloud messaging service and launches super service which checks if the device has the administrator privilege.	1
It also checks its own status and relaunches the app if the app gets close or stopped.	1
It checks privilege in every second and if not available, it starts requesting to the user in an infinite loop.	1
If the application gets the admin privilege then it shows a stub page and hides the application icon from the device.	1
And when Rotexy Trojan detects an attempts to revoke the admin privilege then it starts switching off the user device screen.	1
If privileges are revoked successfully then Rotexy Trojan start requesting for admin privilege again to the user in a loop.	1
Rebooting and switching off the phone	1
Termination of Rotexy Malware Trojan	1
Sending of an SMS using the phone	1
Rotexy Trojan Malware stores the information about the C&C server and infected device data in a local SQLite database.	1
Once, Rotexy Trojan gets the admin privilege then it receives the information from the C&C server that how it needs to operate for example SMS interception templates and HTML page that it needs to show on the application.	1
Rotexy Trojan (Malware) intercept all the incoming SMS and process them according to the templates it received from the C&C server.	1
Rotexy Trojan also puts user’s phone in silent mode and switch of the screen when it received an SMS so the user doesn’t get notified about the incoming message.	1
It can also send a message to the specific phone number with the information that has been received in SMS.	1
With the general information, Rotexy trojan also sends other information to the C&C server like running process and application.	1
Unblock- unblock the user device and revoke the admin privileges	1
URL- update the C&C address or IP	1
Message- Send an SMS with a specified context to a specific phone number	1
CONTACTS- Send text received from the C&C server to all contacts, that is how this is spreading	1
ALL_CONTACTS- send all contact details to the C&C server	1
BLOCKER_BANKING_START- Block the display to show bank’s Phishing HTML page to enter the bank details	1
BLOCKER_EXTORTIONIST_START- Block the display to show Ransome page	1
BLOCKER_UPDATE_START- Block the Display to show device update	1
BLOCKER_STOP- Block display of all HTML pages	1
Rotexy Trojan Blocking the Display:	1
Rotexy Trojan Malware blocks the user’s phone display and shows a Ransome page with some sexually explicit image (that has been covered within a black box).	1
Similarly, Rotexy Trojan Malware blocks the user phone screens and display banking page to enter the bank details.	1
As Rotexy Trojan already has control on your incoming messages and also received bank details then the attacker can perform any transaction or even can change password, ATM card Debit card PIN.	1
One of the features that make it stand out of the crowd is the use at the same time of three separate communication channels for receiving commands.	1
The third method is SMS based and allows the operator to control the actions of malware by sending a text message to the infected mobile phone.	1
Malware analysts Tatyana Shishkova and Lev Pinkman documented the evolution of the Rotexy malware, marking key developments, such as processing SMS communication or applying AES encryption to data exchanged between the target and the C2.	1
Starting late 2016, the trojan showed signs that its focus was on stealing users' bank card data via phishing pages.	1
Later on, the developers added an HTML page that mimicked a login form for a legitimate bank and locked the device screen until the victim provided the necessary information.	1
To make the scam believable, the threat actor included a virtual keyboard that allegedly offered protection against keylogging applications.	1
To lure the victim into giving up the sensitive data, the HTML page shown on the screen informs the victim that they received a money transfer.	1
Its latest version includes a protection mechanism that checks for the country it was launched in and if it runs in an emulated environment.	1
If it is in Russia and on a real system, Rotexy registers with GCM and checks if it has administrator privileges.	1
"""It performs a privilege check once every second; if unavailable, the Trojan starts requesting them from the user in an infinite loop,"" inform the researchers."	1
They added that any attempt to revoke its admin privileges ends with periodically turning off the phone's display, in an attempt to discourage the action.	1
Among the capabilities observed by the researchers is hiding SMS communication from the victim bu putting the phone in silent mode and turning off the screen when the message arrives.	1
Its ransomware features include showing an extortionist HTML page with sexually explicit images and freezing the phone.	1
The malware may start reiterating its request for privileges, and this problem disappears once Rotexy is kicked out of the system: boot in safe mode and remove it.	1
Rotexy malware evaluation was at a peak in 2014 & 2015 and it mainly using the phishing links in order to compromise the users that prompt to install the malicious apps.	1
Rotexy mobile malware keeps requesting the mobile administrative privilege even users restart the mobile in safe mode even the malicious program will be removed.	1
Initially, once an infection starts, the malware checks the device whether any sandbox environment being detected and which country is the victims belonged.	1
Once it successfully finished all the checks then the Rotexy registers with GCM and launches SuperService that help to check the devices admin privileges which keep performing each and every second.	1
Later it displays the application request, requesting root  privileges through an infinite loop to force users to agree and provide the privilege.	1
If the privileges are revoked successfully, the Trojan relaunches the cycle of requesting administrator privileges.”	1
During the background process of Rotexy in the targeted phone, it can able to switching on and rebooting of the phone, termination of its operation, sending of an SMS by the app – in this case, the phone is switched to silent mode.	1
Later the malware using local SQLite database, to store the data that harvested from infected mobile and an information about C&C servers.	1
“Rotexy intercepts all incoming SMSs and processes them according to the templates it received from the C&C.	1
When required, the Trojan sends an SMS to the specified phone number with the information it has received from the intercepted message.”	1
If it doesn’t receive any instruction about rules to process the incoming Messages then it simply stores all the SMS  in local DB and uploads it into the C&C server.	1
Also, The Trojan displays a phishing page (bank.html) prompting the user to enter their bank card details.	1
The latest version of the malware goes well beyond eavesdropping on SMS messages and has incorporated advanced device screen manipulation with the intent of stealing bank card numbers, as well carrying out ransomware attacks, they said.	1
Rotexy’s key ability has always been to intercept and read SMS messages, as well as track a list of all running processes and installed applications (including the possible tracking of antivirus or banking applications).	1
The most current version can block the devices’ screen to perform either ransomware or phishing functions.	1
The most current version of the trojan spreads via links sent in phishing SMSs that prompt the user to install an app.	1
As it launches, the app requests device administrator rights, and then starts communicating with its C&C server.	1
When first launching, the trojan checks to make sure the victim’s device is located in Russia and that it isn’t an emulator used by security researchers to spot malware.	1
If the device checks out, the trojan registers with the mobile notification service Google Cloud Messaging and launches a service to check if the trojan has device administrator privileges, according researchers.	1
“If the privileges are revoked successfully, the Trojan relaunches the cycle of requesting administrator privileges.”	1
Once running, the trojan can track when a phone is switched on or rebooted – and whether text-messages are being sent.	1
To perform SMS tracking capabilities, the trojan sends the infected device’s International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) to the C&C server, and in turn receives a set of rules for processing incoming text messages.	1
“Rotexy intercepts all incoming SMSs and processes them according to the templates it received from the C&C,” researchers said.	1
“Also, when an SMS arrives, the Trojan puts the phone into silent mode and switches off the screen so the user doesn’t notice that a new SMS has arrived.	1
The latest version of Rotexy is able to block the device’s screen for a “long period of time” and displays an extortion page that demands a ransom for unblocking it.	1
Rotexy also displays a tricky phishing page purporting to be a bank, that prompts the user to enter their bank card details.	1
Rotexy does this by intercepting a message from the bank in templates for processing incoming text messages for the victims’ phone.	1
The malware uses infected devices to generate large amounts of fraudulent clicks on advertisements, generating revenues for the perpetrators behind it.	1
To bypass Bouncer, Google Play’s protection, the hackers create a seemingly benign bridgehead app, meant to establish connection to the victim’s device, and insert it into the app store.	1
Once a user downloads a malicious app, it silently registers receivers which establish a connection with the C&C server.	1
The server replies with the actual malicious payload, which includes JavaScript code, a user-agent string and URLs controlled by the malware author.	1
Once the targeted website is launched, the malware uses the JavaScript code to locate and click on banners from the Google ads infrastructure.	1
Hackers can hide their apps’ real intentions or even manipulate users into leaving positive ratings, in some cases unknowingly.	1
"It adds that the malware is ""definitely an illegitimate use of the users' mobile devices for generating fraudulent clicks""."	1
The apps contain code that sends infected devices to a target webpage, where they generate fraudulent clicks on the site's adverts to make money for its creators.	1
Once downloaded, the apps silently register the device to a remote server, which responds by sending back the malicious ad-click software to open a hidden website and generate revenue for the site by clicking on the adverts.	1
Our research exposes how the malware roots infected devices and steals authentication tokens that can be used to access data from Google Play, Gmail, Google Photos, Google Docs, G Suite, Google Drive, and more.	1
Gooligan-infected apps can also be installed using phishing scams where attackers broadcast links to infected apps to unsuspecting users via SMS or other messaging services.	1
By late 2015, the malware’s creators had gone mostly silent until the summer of 2016 when the malware reappeared with a more complex architecture that injects malicious code into Android system processes.	1
The malware simulates clicks on app advertisements provided by legitimate ad networks and forces the app to install on a device.	1
After an infected app is installed, it sends data about the device to the campaign’s Command and Control (C&C) server.	1
Gooligan then downloads a rootkit from the C&C server that takes advantage of multiple Android 4 and 5 exploits including the well-known VROOT (CVE-2013-6282) and Towelroot (CVE-2014-3153).	1
If rooting is successful, the attacker has full control of the device and can execute privileged commands remotely.	1
After achieving root access, Gooligan downloads a new, malicious module from the C&C server and installs it on the infected device.	1
This module injects code into running Google Play or GMS (Google Mobile Services) to mimic user behavior so Gooligan can avoid detection, a technique first seen with the mobile malware HummingBad.	1
Steal a user’s Google email account and authentication token information	1
Install apps from Google Play and rate them to raise their reputation	1
Install adware to generate revenue	1
Then the malware leaves a positive review and a high rating on Google Play using content it receives from the C&C server.	1
Similar to HummingBad, the malware also fakes device identification information, such as IMEI and IMSI, to download an app twice while seeming like the installation is happening on a different device, thereby doubling the potential revenue.	1
The malware nabs email account information and authentication tokens for accessing Google accounts.	1
The attackers use the tokens to install select apps from Google Play on an infected device to boost in-app advertising revenue.	1
According to Check Point, which reported the issue to Google, these tokens can be used to access data from Google Play, Gmail, Google Photos, Google Docs, G Suite, and Google Drive.	1
Rather than use those tokens to steal information, Gooligan-infected devices are designed to go about fraudulently earning their operators ad revenue.	1
To feed the scheme, the malware also forces infected devices to leave positive reviews and a high rating on Google Play.	1
The so-called Gooligan strain has infected as many as 1.3 million Android phones since August, completely prising the devices open and stealing the tokens users are given to verify they are authorized to access accounts.	1
Once Gooligan has control of the phone, the victim's Google account token is siphoned off to a remote server and could be used to gain access to their Gmail, Docs, Drive, Photos and other data, even where two-factor authentication is turned on.	1
The attackers have forced victims to download and give positive reviews to apps on Google Play, which provides an illicit revenue stream as the hackers also run advertisements within the applications.	1
Millions of Google accounts have been compromised in a new attack campaign that uses Android credentials to access data from Google services.	1
It then downloads a malicious module from a command and control (C&C) server which allows Gooligan to steal credentials for email and other services.	1
In addition, the control can be used to install apps from Google Play and rate them using the user’s Google account or install adware on the user’s device to generate revenue.	1
“Then the malware leaves a positive review and a high rating on Google Play using content it receives from the C&C server.”	1
This app, dubbed “TrickMo” by our team, is designed to bypass second factor and strong authentication pushed to bank customers when they need to authorize a transaction.	1
While it’s not the first of its kind, this Android malware app is more sophisticated than similar apps and possesses interesting features that enable its operators to steal transaction authorization codes from victims who download the app.	1
The tweet stated that TrickBot, a well-known banking Trojan owned by an organized cybercrime gang, uses man-in-the-browser (MITB) web injects in online banking sessions to ask infected users for their mobile phone number and device type.	1
On infected PCs, TrickBot displays a query for the mobile phone number and the device type used for banking and then prompts users to install an alleged security app.”	1
In this analysis, we get into the capabilities of the new variant and what we found to be a “kill switch” that can eliminate the malware remotely from an infected device.	1
Usually, when users are already infected with malware like TrickBot on their desktop, they will see a web injection asking for their mobile device operating system (OS) type and phone number.	1
Next, if they indicate that they use an Android-based device, the Trojan, impersonating their bank with web injections, fools the victim into installing a fake security app.	1
Stealing personal device information	1
Intercepting SMS messages	1
Recording targeted applications for one-time password (TAN)	1
Lockdown of the phone	1
Stealing pictures from the device	1
Self-destruction and removal	1
From our analysis of the TrickMo mobile malware, it is apparent that TrickMo is designed to break the newest methods of OTP and, specifically, TAN codes often used in Germany.	1
Among the various features we discuss in this post, we believe that TrickMo’s most significant novelty is an app recording feature, which gives it the ability to overcome the newer pushTAN app validations used by German banks.	1
In the analysis that follows, we describe in detail the capabilities of this new variant and a “kill switch” that can remotely eliminate the malware from a mobile device.	1
Around 2011, the infamous Zeus Trojan started using web injects that tricked users into downloading a mobile component called “ZitMo” (Zeus in the Mobile).	1
This was used to bypass 2FA methods by intercepting the SMS messages coming from the bank and stealing the mTANs without the victim’s knowledge.	1
To get around this challenge, TrickMo’s developers added some new features to steal TANs using screen video recording and screen data scraping.	1
It abuses accessibility services.	1
Once on the device, as installed by a duped user, the TrickMo component opens and sends an intent to start the accessibility settings activity, coercing the user to grant it with accessibility permissions.	1
Preventing the user from uninstalling the app	1
Becoming the default SMS app by changing device settings	1
Monitoring the currently running application(s)	1
Scraping on-screen text	1
TrickMo uses accessibility services to identify and control some of these screens and make its own choices before giving the user a chance to react.	1
This instruction is especially important for malware that tries to avoid user interaction by running in the background as a service.	1
It then uses the AlarmManager to set a pending intent that will run its own service after a predefined interval.	1
In other words, TrickMo’s service will start either after the device becomes interactive or after a new SMS message is received.	1
TrickMo uses the shared preferences mechanism to store settings and data that the malware uses at runtime.	1
Kill switch status	1
To keep its resources safer and make analysis more difficult for researchers, TrickMo uses an obfuscator to scramble the names of its functions, classes and variables.	1
A TrickMo version from January 2020 contained code that checks if the app is running on a rooted device or an emulator to prevent analysis.	1
When it runs, it periodically connects to its designated server via an unencrypted HTTP request and sends over a JSON object that contains data gleaned from the victim’s phone.	1
As some banks still use SMS-based transaction authorization, TrickMo is configured to automatically steal all SMS messages that are stored on the device.	1
Once in a while, it sends a packet to its C&C server containing the collected device data along with all the saved SMS messages.	1
Since it can use the accessibility service to become the default SMS app, it can also delete the SMS messages so only the attackers can see them.	1
In addition, TrickMo has an automatic mechanism to send SMS messages to its C&C server.	1
In some cases, it uses this mechanism to send log data of important actions.	1
It can save an SMS message on the device, marking with “internal” in the phone number field.	1
The SMS message will be instantly sent to the server, informing the malware operator of executed tasks.	1
In the image below, we see a log TrickMo sent to the attacker upon becoming the default SMS app.	1
SMS Control	1
Update the address of the C&C server — SMS starting with “http://”	1
Send AES-encrypted SMS message back to sender — SMS starting with “sms://”	1
Update service wake-up interval — “2”	1
Kill switch — “4”	1
Update the address of the C&C server — “1”	1
Lock the screen — “5”	1
Display a picture in a WebView from an arbitrary URL — “11”	1
Send an arbitrary SMS message — “8”	1
Steal images saved on the device — “12” and “13”	1
Use the accessibility service to become the default SMS app — “6”	1
Enable recording of other apps — “15”	1
Desktop banking malware often blocks the user’s access to their banking website after a successful transaction by using web injects that show a variety of “service unavailable” screens.	1
After performing a fraudulent action, stealing the OTP/mTAN, TrickMo buys some time by activating the lock screen and preventing the user from accessing their device.	1
Due to TrickMo’s persistence implementation mentioned earlier, this lockdown screen persists after a restart and is re-initiated every time the device becomes interactive.	1
In some cases, TrickMo may use this feature to intercept SMS messages without the knowledge of the user by activating the lockdown screen and intercepting SMS messages in the background.	1
The feature that makes TrickMo different from standard SMS stealers is its unique ability to record the screen when targeted apps are running.	1
Using the Android MediaRecorder class to capture a video of the screen when the targeted application is presented to the user	1
Using the accessibility service to save a text file containing the data of all the objects on the screen	1
Kill switches are used by many malware authors to remove traces from a device after a successful operation.	1
If the returned JSON object has the “4” key, it will turn on the kill switch and initiate its own removal by sending an intent and seamlessly confirming the uninstall using the accessibility service, all without the victim ever noticing anything.	1
One of the most significant features TrickMo possesses is the app recording feature, which is what gives TrickBot the ability to overcome the newer pushTAN app validations deployed by banks.	1
TrickBot uses a malicious Android app to bypass 2FA by various banks	1
Malware authors released a new Android application that can intercept one-time authorization codes sent to various online banking customers via SMS or push notification.	1
This malicious app is developed to intercept one-time password, mobile TAN and pushTAN authentication codes.	1
The Windows computers infected by TrickBot employed man-in-the-browser (MitB) attacks to ask victims for their online banking mobile phone numbers and device types in order to prompt them to install a fake security app — now called TrickMo.	1
This malware has capability of preventing users from uninstalling the application as it sets itself as a go-to SMS app and monitors running applications, and scrap text from the screen directly.	1
TrickMo can access the service and control these screens.	1
This is how malware can delete SMS messages and forward them to its masters, so the victim cannot be aware that their device received a text message with the needed 2FA code from the bank service.	1
When the SMS is received, the screen turns on, or the phone is rebooted malicious app can also restart itself.	1
Steal pictures and device information from the phone.	1
Intercept SMS messages and also lock the phone completely.	1
Record applications for OTP, mTAN and pushTAN theft.	1
Self-destruct and remove all traces.	1
The malware authors behind TrickBot banking Trojan have developed a new Android app that can intercept one-time authorization codes sent to Internet banking customers via SMS or relatively more secure push notifications, and complete fraudulent transactions.	1
The development is the latest addition in the arsenal of evolving capabilities of the banking trojan that has since morphed to deliver other kinds of malware, including the notorious Ryuk ransomware, act as an info stealer, loot Bitcoin wallets, and harvest emails and credentials.	1
Initially spotted by the CERT-Bund last September, the TrickMo campaign works by intercepting a wide range of transaction authentication numbers (TANs), including one-time password (OTP), mobile TAN (mTAN), and pushTAN authentication codes after victims install it on their Android devices.	1
CERT-Bund's advisory went on to state that the Windows computers infected by TrickBot employed man-in-the-browser (MitB) attacks to ask victims for their online banking mobile phone numbers and device types in order to prompt them to install a fake security app — now called TrickMo.	1
To get over this hurdle of getting hold of the app's push notifications, TrickMo makes use of Android's accessibility features that allows it to record a video of the app's screen, scrape the data displayed on the screen, monitor currently running applications and even set itself as the default SMS app.	1
What's more, it prevents users of infected devices from uninstalling the app.	1
Once installed, TrickMo is also capable of gaining persistence by starting itself after the device becomes interactive or after a new SMS message is received.	1
In addition, it features an elaborate settings mechanism that lets a remote attacker issue commands to turn on/off specific features (e.g., accessibility permissions, recording status, SMS app status) via a command-and-control (C2) server or an SMS message.	1
When the malware is run, it exfiltrates a wide range of information, including —	1
Specifically, it uses a fake Android update screen to mask its OTP-stealing operations.	1
And lastly, it comes with self-destruction and removal functions, which allows the cybercrime gang behind TrickMo to remove all traces of the malware's presence from a device after a successful operation.	1
"One of the most significant features TrickMo possesses is the app recording feature, which is what gives TrickBot the ability to overcome the newer pushTAN app validations deployed by banks."""	1
The TrickBot trojan has a new trick up its sleeve for bypassing a new kind of two-factor authentication (2FA) security method used by banks – by fooling its victims into downloading a malicious Android app.	1
Researchers first discovered the mobile app after a September 2019 tweet by CERT-Bund flagging TrickBot using man-in-the-browser techniques.	1
In this case, TrickBot was modifying the pages to ask the victims for their mobile phone numbers and device operating system types (Android or iOS).	1
If victims indicated that they were using Android-based devices, the trojan would then use web injections and social engineering to fool the victim into installing a fake security app — this turned out to be the TrickMo app.	1
Once downloaded, the app steals personal device information, intercepts SMS messages, locks the phone, steals pictures and records the device screen.	1
The malware also has its own kill switch, a feature often used by malware authors to remove traces from a device after a successful operation.	1
TrickBot already has various data-stealing capabilities, so why would it deploy an additional piece of malware with these features?	1
Researchers believe that some of TrickMo’s functionalities, specifically the ability to record targeted applications, help the trojan obtain a one-time password (OTP) or transaction authentication number, with the goal of bypassing 2FA protections put in place by banks.	1
“We believe that TrickMo’s most significant novelty is an app-recording feature, which gives it the ability to overcome the newer pushTAN app validations used by German banks,” they said.	1
TrickMo’s features are designed to bypass this extra type of authentication – specifically, via its ability to record mobile phone screens.	1
This screen-recording feature abuses accessibility services in Android.	1
Once downloaded, TrickMo uses the accessibility settings to carry out various malicious operations, including preventing users from uninstalling the app, becoming the default SMS app (by changing device settings), monitoring any running apps and scraping on-screen text.	1
Also this past month, TrickBot added a Windows 10 ActiveX control to execute malicious macros.	1
In September 2019, Volexity published Digital Crackdown: Large-Scale Surveillance and Exploitation of Uyghurs, which described a series of attacks against Uyghurs from multiple Chinese APT actors.	1
The Evil Eye threat actor was observed launching an exploit aimed at installing a malware implant on Android phones.	1
The Evil Eye actor set up IRONSQUIRREL code to be loaded in a variety of different ways through malicious iframes across the various compromised websites.	1
This encrypts all C2 activity, to include data exfiltration.	1
The malware conducts C2 server validation using a certificate embedded in the malware and will not function if validation fails.	1
The malware employs basic obfuscation techniques to obscure some of its embedded strings.	1
In addition to exfiltrating information about the phone and targeted apps, the malware now automatically sends information about each additional app that is installed on the device during its initial phone-home.	1
The implant made extensive use of obfuscated strings to hide file names, API names, URL parameters, and other data relevant to its operations.	1
Once installed, the malware granted access to a user's Contacts, location, Messages data, and information from third-party apps.	1
Unlike other rooting malware, this Trojan not only installs its modules into the system, it also injects malicious code into the system runtime libraries.	1
It uses a variety of new techniques, but the most interesting thing is that it injects malicious code into the system libraries – libdmv.so or libandroid_runtime.so.	1
This makes Dvmap the first Android malware that injects malicious code into the system libraries in runtime, and it has been downloaded from the Google Play Store more than 50,000 times.	1
To bypass Google Play Store security checks, the malware creators used a very interesting method: they uploaded a clean app to the store at the end of March, 2017, and would then update it with a malicious version for short period of time.	1
During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules.	1
It will check the version of Android installed and decide which library should be patched.	1
It installs malicious modules with different functionality into the system.	1
The most interesting thing, as stated above, is that it injects malicious code into the system libraries, such as libdmv.so or libandroid_runtime.so.	1
The malware (Dvmap) was uploaded to Google Play Store masked as several simple apps such as Puzzle Games.	1
To bypass Google Play Store security checks, the malware creators uploaded a clean app to the play store and then update it with a malicious version for a short period of time.	1
Dvmap Trojan works on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Android, which once installed, attempts to gain root access on the device and tries to install several modules on the system including a few written in Chinese, along with a malicious app called “com.qualcmm.timeservices.	1
To make sure the malicious module gets executed with system rights, the malware overwrites system’s runtime libraries depending on which Android version the device is running.	1
To complete the installation of the above-mentioned malicious app, the Trojan with system rights turns off “Verify Apps,” feature and modify system setting to allow app installation from 3rd party app stores.	1
This malicious 3rd party app is responsible for connecting the infected device to the attacker’s command-and-control server, giving out full control of the device into the hands of attackers.	1
Zen uses root permissions on a device to automatically enable a service that creates fake Google accounts.	1
Zen apps gain access to root permissions from a rooting trojan in its infection chain.	1
In April 2013, we saw the first sample, which made heavy use of dynamic code loading (i.e., fetching executable code from remote sources after the initial app is installed).	1
This sample displayed ads from various sources.	1
More recent variants blend rooting capabilities and click fraud.	1
As rooting exploits on Android become less prevalent and lucrative, PHA authors adapt their abuse or monetization strategy to focus on tactics like click fraud.	1
The simplest PHA from the author's portfolio used a specially crafted advertisement SDK to create a proxy for all ads-related network traffic.	1
This approach allows the authors to combine ads from third-party advertising networks with ads they created for their own apps.	1
Click fraud PHAs simulate user clicks on ads instead of simply displaying ads and waiting for users to click them.	1
The click fraud PHA requests a URL to the advertising network directly instead of proxying it through an additional SDK.	1
The command & control server (C&C server) returns the URL to click along with a very long list of additional parameters in JSON format.	1
After rendering the ad on the screen, the app tries to identify the part of the advertisement website to click.	1
If that part is found, the app loads Javascript snippets from the JSON parameters to click a button or other HTML element, simulating a real user click.	1
Using a publicly available rooting framework, the PHA attempts to root devices and gain persistence on them by reinstalling itself on the system partition of rooted device.	1
After achieving persistence, the trojan downloads additional payloads, including another trojan called Zen.	1
Zen requires root to work correctly on the Android operating system.	1
The Zen trojan uses its root privileges to turn on accessibility service (a service used to allow Android users with disabilities to use their devices) for itself by writing to a system-wide setting value enabled_accessibility_services.	1
The trojan implements three accessibility services directed at different Android API levels and uses these accessibility services, chosen by checking the operating system version, to create new Google accounts.	1
The app then clicks the appropriate buttons, scrollbars, and other UI elements to go through account sign-up without user intervention.	1
To get around this, the app then uses its root privilege to inject code into the Setup Wizard, extract the CAPTCHA image, and sends it to a remote server to try to solve the CAPTCHA.	1
Apart from injecting code to read the CAPTCHA, the app also injects its own code into the system_server process, which requires root privileges.	1
This indicates that the app tries to hide itself from any anti-PHA systems that look for a specific app process name or does not have the ability to scan the memory of the system_server process.	1
The app also creates hooks to prevent the phone from rebooting, going to sleep or allowing the user from pressing hardware buttons during the account creation process.	1
First, the app has to turn off SELinux protection.	1
Then the app finds a process id value for the process it wants to inject with code.	1
Zen family PHA authors exhibit a wide range of techniques, from simply inserting an advertising SDK to a sophisticated trojan.	1
The app that resulted in the largest number of affected users was the click fraud version, which was installed over 170,000 times at its peak in February 2018.	1
In most cases, these click fraud apps were uninstalled by the users, probably due to the low quality of the apps.	1
XLoader Android Spyware and Banking Trojan Distributed via DNS Spoofing	1
The attacks use Domain Name System (DNS) cache poisoning/DNS spoofing, possibly through infringement techniques such as brute-force or dictionary attacks, to distribute and install malicious Android apps.	1
These malware pose as legitimate Facebook or Chrome applications.	1
XLoader can also hijack the infected device (i.e., send SMSs) and sports self-protection/persistence mechanisms through device administrator privileges.	1
As with our earlier reports in late March, the attack chain involves diverting internet traffic to attacker-specified domains by compromising and overwriting the router’s DNS settings.	1
A fake alert will notify and urge the user to access the malicious domain and download XLoader.	1
XLoader first loads the encrypted payload from Assets/db as test.dex to drop the necessary modules then requests for device administrator privileges.	1
Once granted permission, it hides its icon from the launcher application list then starts a service that it keeps running in the background.	1
XLoader creates a provisional web server to receive the broadcast events.	1
It shows a web phishing page whenever the affected device receives a broadcast event (i.e., if a new package is installed or if the device’s screen is on) to steal personal data, such as those keyed in for banking apps.	1
XLoader can also collect information related to usage of apps installed in the device.	1
Its data-stealing capabilities include collecting SMSs after receiving an SMS-related broadcast event and covertly recording phone calls.	1
XLoader can also hijack accounts linked to financial or game-related apps installed on the affected device.	1
XLoader can also start other attacker-specified packages.	1
A possible attack scenario involves replacing legitimate apps with repackaged or malicious versions.	1
This enables it to launch malicious apps without the user’s awareness and explicit consent.	1
XLoader also prevents victims from accessing the device’s settings or using a known antivirus (AV) app in the country.	1
XLoader can also load multiple malicious modules to receive and execute commands from its remote command-and-control (C&C) server, as shown below:	1
sendSms — send SMS/MMS to a specified address	1
setWifi — enable or disable Wi-Fi connection	1
gcont — collect all the device’s contacts	1
bc — collect all contacts from the Android device and SIM card	1
setForward — currently not implemented, but can be used to hijack the infected device	1
getForward — currently not implemented, but can be used to hijack the infected device	1
hasPkg — check the device whether a specified app is installed or not	1
setRingerMode — set the device’s ringer mode	1
setRecEnable — set the device’s ringer mode as silent	1
reqState — get a detailed phone connection status, which includes activated network and Wi-Fi (with or without password)	1
showHome — force the device’s back to the home screen	1
getnpki: get files/content from the folder named NPKI (contains certificates related to financial transactions)	1
http — access a specified network using HttpURLConnection	1
onRecordAction — simulate a number-dialed tone	1
call — call a specified number	1
get_apps — get all the apps installed on the device	1
show_fs_float_window — show a full-screen window for phishing	1
Of note is XLoader’s abuse of the WebSocket protocol (supported in many browsers and web applications) via ws(WebSockets) or wss(WebSockets over SSL/TLS) to communicate with its C&C servers.	1
The abuse of the WebSocket protocol provides XLoader with a persistent connection between clients and servers where data can be transported any time.	1
XLoader abuses the MessagePack (a data interchange format) to package the stolen data and exfiltrate it via the WebSocket protocol for faster and more efficient transmission.	1
XLoader was first spotted in April 2018 posing as legitimate Facebook or Chrome apps.	1
XLoader is a backdoor trojan and Android malware that uses Domain Name System (DNS) spoofing to distribute infected Android apps.	1
The malicious apps collect device owners’ personal information and financial information.	1
XLoader distributed via DNS domains	1
These apps were distributed via polluted DNS domains that send notifications to victims’ devices.	1
Once the malicious app is installed on the mobile device, it can hijack the device and gain persistence via device administrator privileges.	1
After which, XLoader can steal device owners’ personal information as well as download additional malware.	1
Researchers who found a connection between the two malware and the Yanbian Gang noted that they initially discovered the connection during a malware campaign that saw XLoader malware disguised as a legitimate app of a major Japanese home delivery service company in June 2018.	1
Researchers detected a new version of the XLoader malware ‘XLoader v 6.0’ that poses as a security app for Android devices and uses a malicious iOS profile to affect iPhone and iPad devices.	1
XLoader version 6.0 abuses Twitter profiles to hide its C&C server.	1
In April 2019, researchers uncovered ‘XLoader version 7.0’ that poses as a pornography app for Android devices.	1
This variant abuses Instagram and Tumblr profiles to hide its C&C server.	1
This new XLoader variant poses as a security app for Android devices, and uses a malicious iOS profile to affect iPhone and iPad devices.	1
The threat actors behind this version used several fake websites as their host — copying that of a Japanese mobile phone operator’s website in particular — to trick users into downloading the fake security Android application package (APK).	1
In the past, XLoader showed the ability to mine cryptocurrency on PCs and perform account phishing on iOS devices.	1
Like its previous versions, XLoader 6.0 abuses social media user profiles to hide its real C&C addresses, but this time its threat actors chose the social media platform Twitter, which was never used in previous attacks.	1
Version 6.0 also adds a command called “getPhoneState”, which collects unique identifiers of mobile devices such as IMSI, ICCID, Android ID, and device serial number.	1
While monitoring this particular threat, we found another XLoader variant posing as a pornography app aimed at South Korean users.	1
Succeeding monitoring efforts revealed a newer variant that exploits the social media platforms Instagram and Tumblr instead of Twitter to hide its C&C address.	1
We labeled this new variant XLoader version 7.0, because of the different deployment method and its use of the native code to load the payload and hide in Instagram and Tumblr profiles.	1
It had again cloned a different legitimate Japanese website to host its malicious app, similar to what FakeSpy had also done before.	1
XLoader 6.0 also mirrors the way FakeSpy hides its real C&C server.	1
When before it had used several different social media platforms, it now uses the Twitter platform, something FakeSpy has done in its past attacks.	1
New XLoader Variant Masquerades as Android Security Apps, iOS Configuration Profile	1
A new variant of XLoader is masquerading as Android security apps and an iOS configuration profile to target mobile users.	1
Trend Micro detected the variant while analyzing a smishing campaign that tricked mobile users into visiting one of several fake websites, including a clone of a Japanese mobile phone operator.	1
Whenever an Android user visited a malicious site and/or pressed any of the available buttons, the campaign triggered the download of an Android Package (APK) for fake security software (assuming the user has enabled the installation of third-party apps in their Unknown Sources settings).	1
In the event an iOS user visited one of the malicious websites, the campaign redirected to another website that prompted them to download a malicious iOS configuration profile.	1
Trend Micro first observed efforts to distribute XLoader disguised as legitimate Facebook and Chrome apps in April 2018.	1
We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook.	1
The surveillance functionality of Desert Scorpion resides in a second stage payload that can only be downloaded if the victim has downloaded, installed, and interacted with the first-stage chat application.	1

Such references would be in line with FrozenCell's phishing tactics in which they used file names to lure people associated with the political party to open malicious documents.	1
Researchers say they have uncovered a new Android spyware variant with an updated command-and-control communication strategy and extended surveillance capabilities that snoops on social media apps WhatsApp and Telegram.	1
The detected malware samples were disguised as a legitimate messaging app offered through Google Play.	1
Previously documented versions of this spyware have various capabilities, including the ability to take pictures, record audio, exfiltrate call logs, SMS messages and contacts and more.	1
They would do so by requesting a number of invasive permissions, using social engineering-like techniques to fool technically inexperienced users.	1
This latest version has extended surveillance capabilities, specifically targeting information collected from social media and messaging apps.	1
The spyware can now record victims’ screens and take screenshots, record incoming and outgoing calls in WhatsApp and read text of notifications from social media apps, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Skype and Messenger.	1
The malware also leverages a tactic where it creates a blank screen overlay to put on the Android screen while it makes calls, which helps it hide its call activity.	1
In another technique to hide its activity the malware can dismiss its own notifications.	1
Finally, the new version of the malware can dismiss notifications from built-security security apps for Android devices (allowing it to hide security warnings of suspicious activity from the victim), including Samsung notifications, SecurityLogAgent notifications on Samsung devices, MIUI Security notifications on Xiaomi devices and Phone Manager on Huawei devices.	1
Also known by the monikers VAMP, FrozenCell, GnatSpy, and Desert Scorpion, the mobile spyware has been a preferred tool of choice for the APT-C-23 threat group since at least 2017, with successive iterations featuring extended surveillance functionality to vacuum files, images, contacts and call logs, read notifications from messaging apps, record calls (including WhatsApp), and dismiss notifications from built-in Android security apps.	1
In the past, the malware has been distributed via fake Android app stores under the guise of AndroidUpdate, Threema, and Telegram.	1
The latest campaign is no different in that they take the form of apps that purport to install updates on the target's phone with names such as App Updates, System Apps Updates, and Android Update Intelligence.	1
It's believed that the attackers deliver the spyware app by sending a download link to the targets through smishing messages.	1
Once installed, the app begins requesting for invasive permissions to perform a string of malicious activities that are designed to slip past any attempts to manually remove the malware.	1
The app not only changes its icon to hide behind popular apps such as Chrome, Google, Google Play, and YouTube, in the event the user were to click the fraudulent icon, the legitimate version of the app is launched, while running surveillance tasks in the background.	1
The malware allows its users to steal data from a target’s phone including text messages, device location, contacts and more.	1
It can record phone calls, video and surrounding audio.	1
Desert Scorpion can also uninstall apps.	1
Once installed, the app would download a second app that masqueraded as a generic “settings” application, which is capable of tracking the device’s location, record calls, video, and surrounding audio, retrieve files found on external storage and them to a C&C server, retrieve text messages, contacts and account information, uninstall apps, and more.	1
In the case of the ViperRAT apps, built with a focus on social networking and chat, the apps, once installed, would profile the device and try to download a second-stage surveillance component.	1
Meanwhile, the Desert Scorpion app also uses a second-stage payload that downloads malicious components when a user interacts with the app.	1
That component gains almost unfettered access to the device -- and the ability to grab devices, metadata, track a user's locations, send messages, record surrounding audio, calls, and video -- all while running silently in the background.	1
In both cases, the actors behind the malicious apps used phishing schemes to trick targets into downloading the apps.	1
With ViperRAT, the malicious functionality within one of the apps looks almost indistinguishable from other social networking apps and obfuscated from view during the app store approval process.	1

command-and-control (C&C) servers, used to remotely send/receive malicious commands	1
The first method is to send a specially crafted URL to the target via SMS or email.	1
The second method is to use a stealthy backdoor app such as ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A, which was designed to bypass Google Play.	1
The said exploits will root the device and install a shell backdoor.	1
One of its most notable routines is capturing voice calls in real time by hooking into the “mediaserver” system service.	1

To avoid detection and removal of the agent app in the device memory, the RCSAndroid suite also detects emulators or sandboxes, obfuscates code using DexGuard, uses ELF string obfuscator, and adjusts the OOM (out-of-memory) value.	1
Interestingly, one unused feature of the app is its ability to manipulate data in the Android package manager to add and remove permissions and components as well as hide the app icon.	1
This will allow the attacker to gain root privilege, and allow the installation of a shell backdoor and RCS Android.	1
The former is responsible for the spying routines: gathering device information, capturing screenshots and photos, recording speech by using the devices’ microphone, capturing voice calls, recording location, capturing Wi-Fi and online account passwords, collecting contacts and decoding messages from IM accounts, as well as collecting SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages.	1
It can sync configuration data, upgrade modules, and download new payloads; upload the above mentioned collected data to the C&C server, and purge it from the device; execute shell commands; disable the network, root access; reset the device’s locking password; uninstall the bot.	1
“To avoid detection and removal of the agent app in the device memory, the RCSAndroid suite also detects emulators or sandboxes, obfuscates code using DexGuard, uses ELF string obfuscator, and adjusts the OOM (out-of-memory) value,” the researchers shared.	1
“Interestingly, one unused feature of the app is its ability to manipulate data in the Android package manager to add and remove permissions and components as well as hide the app icon.”	1

"Some indicators may come in the form of peculiar behavior such as unexpected rebooting, finding unfamiliar apps installed, or instant messaging apps suddenly freezing."""	1
Project Spy uses the ongoing coronavirus pandemic as a lure, posing as an app called Coronavirus Updates.	1
We also found similarities in two older samples disguised as a Google service and, subsequently, as a music app after further investigation.	1
At the end of March 2020, we came across an app masquerading as a coronavirus update app, which we named Project Spy based on the login page of its backend server.	1

When users click on the link provided, they're prompted to update their phone's Adobe Flash player, which instead installs the virus on their phone, according to Cloudmark.	1
"""It can access your microphone, it can access your camera, it can access SMS, it can access your call logs, your internet, your GPS so it knows where you are,"" Kalember added."	1
"According to Kalember, the TangleBot malware has the capability to show hacked users an ""overlay"" screen that appears authentic but is instead a fake window being run by attackers to steal information."	1
For example, TangleBot uses advanced behaviors and transmission capabilities, along with a string decryption routine that helps to obfuscate its presence.	1
Silently call contacts and block calls	1
Send and receive text messages	1
Record the audio, screen or both, then stream them to another device	1
Place overlay screens on the device, obscuring apps and screens	1
Deploy further device observation or espionage capabilities	1
TangleBot equally gains control of the device but in far more invasive manner than the FlutBot malware.	1
TangleBot Android malware is installed when an unsuspecting user clicks on a malicious link disguised as COVID-19 vaccination appointment-related information in an SMS message or information about fake local power outages that are due to occur.	1
The aim behind both or either of the messages (on COVID-19 or impending power outages) is to encourage potential victims to follow a link that supposedly offers detailed information.	1
Once at the page, users are asked to update applications such as Adobe Flash Player to view the page’s content by going through nine (9) dialogue boxes to give acceptance to different permissions that will allow the malware operators initiate the malware configuration process.	1
The immediate consequence to this, is that TangleBot gains access to several different permissions when installed on a device, allowing it to eavesdrop on user communications.	1
The malware then steals sensitive data stored on the device and monitors almost every user activity, including camera use, audio conversations, and location, among other things.	1
Furthermore, the malware takes complete control of the targeted device, including access to banking data, and can reach the deepest recesses of the Android operating system.	1
The mobile baddie grants itself access to almost everything, enabling spying, data-harvesting, stalking and fraud attacks, among others.	1
According to Cloudmark researchers, the newly discovered mobile malware is spreading via SMS messaging in the U.S. and Canada, using lures about COVID-19 boosters and regulations.	1
The goal is to social-engineer targets into clicking on an embedded link, which takes them to a website.	1
In propagation and theme, TangleBot resembles other mobile malware, such as the FluBot SMS malware that targets the U.K. and Europe or the CovidLock Android ransomware, which is an Android app that pretends to give users a way to find nearby COVID-19 patients.	1
“The malware has been given the moniker TangleBot because of its many levels of obfuscation and control over a myriad of entangled device functions, including contacts, SMS and phone capabilities, call logs, internet access, [GPS], and camera and microphone,” they noted in a Thursday writeup.	1
To reach such a long arm into Android’s internal business, TangleBot grants itself privileges to access and control all of the above, researchers said, meaning that the cyberattackers would now have carte blanche to mount attacks with a staggering array of goals.	1
For instance, attackers can manipulate the incoming voice call function to block calls and can also silently make calls in the background, with users none the wiser.	1
TangleBot can also send, obtain and process text messages for SMS fraud, two-factor authentication interception, self-propagation to contacts and more.	1
It also has deep spyware capabilities, with the ability to record or directly stream camera, screen or microphone audio directly to the attacker, along with “other device observation capabilities,” according to Cloudmark.	1
Gaining access to the GPS functionality, for example, creates the potential for stalkery location-tracking.	1
And last but not least, the firm noted that the malware can take stock of installed applications and interact with them, as well as place overlay screens on top of these to, say, harvest credentials in the style of a banking trojan.	1
“As we have seen with FluBot, TangleBot can overlay banking or financial apps and directly steal the victim’s account credentials….The capabilities also enable the theft of considerable personal information directly from the device.”	1
A cyber security company, Proofpoint/Cloudmark has recently identified a new threat that can take over the victim’s mobile phone through SMS.	1
This security threat has been named as the Tangle Bot due to its ability to takeover a number of device’s functions that may include contact list, phone history, camera and microphone along with the ability to use Internet.	1
Just like the name Tangle, this malware can mislead the target to install the tampered software received by a forged Covid-19 alert.	1
With the ongoing pandemic, which has already created panic, such types of messages can fuel up the target and will somehow trick them to click on the link attached with the message believing that the link will provide more information regarding Boosters as well the governmental policies for Covid-19.	1
After tapping the highlighted link, the web display will show that the Adobe Flash Player needs to be updated, if the user agrees to update it by tapping the installation button for update, TangleBot will be installed and will start taking over functions including getting control on phone book, recording screen, opening device camera and mic whenever the attacker wants too.	1
According to Proofpoint , TangleBot can even get access to online financial applications by overlaying the screen.	1
TangleBot Android malware is installed when an unsuspecting user clicks on a malicious link disguised as COVID-19 vaccination appointment-related information in an SMS message or information about fake local power outages that are due to occur.”	1
The TangleBot malware is distributed via a text message to mainly Android users.	1
In order to gain access to the user’s device, the fraudsters send messages that are familiar to the user and implore them to read more or find more detailed information by clicking a provided link.	1
When users click the provided link, the TangleBot malware takes over the device, providing the fraudsters access to financial information, personal information, etc.	1
This means that it tries to send messages that will interest the targeted user.	1
For example, coronavirus related information or bonanza or gifts.	1
Recording the audio, screen, or both, then streaming them to another device.	1
Placing overlay screens on the device, to obscure apps and screens.	1
Silently, calling contacts and blocking calls.	1
Sending and receiving text messages.	1
Deploying further device observation or espionage capabilities	1
While other types of Malware are internet based, capitalizing on social media apps to lure users, TangleBot only operates as text messages.	1
Although TangleBot protects itself deletion, experts say,  users can manually remove it from their device by using Android’s safe boot.	1
As outlined earlier,  malware such as FluBot and TangleBot can overlay banking or financial apps and directly steal the victim’s account credentials.	1
Instead of being controlled by a traditional command-and-control server, it receives instructions via tweets.	1
Android/Twitoor is a backdoor capable of downloading other malware onto an infected device.	1
This malicious app, detected by ESET as a variant of Android/Twitoor.A, can’t be found on any official Android app store – it probably spreads by SMS or via malicious URLs.	1
It impersonates a porn player app or MMS application but without having their functionality.	1
After launching, it hides its presence on the system and checks the defined Twitter account at regular intervals for commands.	1
Based on received commands, it can either download malicious apps or switch the C&C Twitter account to another one.	1
To make the Twitoor botnet’s communication more resilient, botnet designers took various steps like encrypting their messages, using complex topologies of the C&C network – or using innovative means for communication, among them the use of social networks.	1
It’s the first known mobile malware to use this kind of social media account instead of a command-and-control server to exercise its power over infected devices.	1
It’s called Twitoor, and this Trojan apparently lies dormant on Android devices, and awaits commands from a malicious Twitter account.	1
Commands can either tell Twitoor to download and install other applications — generally of the data-stealing mobile banking malware variety — or switch to another command-and-control Twitter account.	1
In this campaign, the spyware is used to first do a complete scan of the device and capture personal information about the targeted victim.	1
After this, the attackers gain access to the users' preferences, device usage, inactivity times, and have the ability to record their screens.	1
Using the spyware, the attackers could do anything from credential stealing and information exfiltration, to money transfers and blackmailing.	1
It can also be used to surreptitiously turn the volume of the phone down and block calls or messages.	1
"The malware, dubbed Mandrake by its discoverers at Bitdefender, can take ""complete control of the device"" and can steal information and cryptocurrency, break into bank accounts, and even factory-reset infected phones to cover its tracks."	1
If you install one of these innocent-looking apps, it collects information about your device and your surroundings, but otherwise does nothing terrible.	1
Mandrake tricks you by putting fake overlays on your screen, such as an end-user license agreement that must be agreed to.	1
Then Mandrake forwards all your text messages to the attackers, forwards phone calls to other numbers, blocks calls, installs or remove apps, steals contact lists, hides notifications, records screen activity, steals passwords to your Facebook and online bank accounts, creates phishing pages to leech your credentials for Gmail and Amazon, and tracks your location.	1
Unlike run of the mill malware, Mandrake puts in significant effort NOT to infect victims.	1
It cherry-picks a handful of devices it gets installed on for further exploitation.	1
This is likely because its operators know that they increase their chances of being called out with every device they infect, so they have instructed the malware to avoid countries where compromised devices won’t bring them any return of interest.	1
The malware also uses advanced manipulation tactics to bait users.	1
For instance, it re-draws what the user sees on the screen to hijack taps.	1
What the users perceive as accepting an End-User License Agreement is actually a complex series of requesting and receiving extremely powerful permissions.	1
With those permissions, the malware gets complete control of the device and data on it.	1
Mandrake spyware hoovers up information raging from account credentials, screen records, GPS and more -- and has been for years.	1
Mandrake spyware abuses legitimate Android functions to help gain access to everything on the compromised device in attacks that can gather almost any information about the user.	1
The attacker can browse and collect all data on the device, steal account credentials for accounts including banking applications.	1
secretly take recordings of activity on the screen, track the GPS location of the user and more, all while continuously covering their tracks.	1
"""The ultimate goal of Mandrake is complete control of the device, as well as account compromise."	1
It isn't clear exactly how widespread the campaigns are, but the malware isn't spammed out like other campaigns – the attackers appear to carefully pick their victims and once they have a valued target compromised, they'll manually control the actions of Mandrake in order to manipulate the most information out of the user as possible.	1
And when the attackers have gained all the information they want from the victim, Mandrake has a kill-switch that wipes the malware from the device.	1
Mandrake's operators have put serious effort into making sure it has stayed hidden over the years, even going so far as to develop, upload and maintain several applications on the Google Play Store – under the names of several different developers.	1
The app is installed on the phone and it then contacts the server to download a loader, which then provides the additional capabilities Mandrake needs to take control of the device.	1
"""The malware operates in stages, with the first stage being a benign app with no malicious behaviour, other than the ability to download and install a second-stage payload when expressly directed to do so."	1
The malware tricks the user into providing it with additional privileges on the device.	1
"With those permissions, the malware gets complete control of the device and data on it,"" said Botezatu."	1
The malware’s many capabilities include stealing account credentials, recording activity displayed on the screen, and GPS tracking.	1
The threat actor behind the malware appears to specifically target certain valuable users with the intent to take over their devices and compromise their accounts.	1
Then, the app tricks the user into granting excessive permissions by displaying what appears to be a request to accept the End-User License Agreement.	1
After the malware is downloaded and steals the desired information, a kill-switch is engaged that wipes any evidence of Mandrake from the device.	1
ESET researchers have analyzed an extremely dangerous Android app that can perform a host of nefarious actions, notably wiping out the victim’s bank account or cryptocurrency wallet and taking over their email or social media accounts.	1
The app is fitted with standard information-stealing capabilities; however, this banker is exceptionally insidious in that after installation it requires a single action from the victim – enable Android’s Accessibility Service – to fully unleash the app’s malicious functionality.	1
Its creators reduced the app’s malicious surface to the bare minimum by removing all potentially malicious functionalities but one: abusing Accessibility Service.	1
allow modify system settings	1
permit drawing over other apps, and	1
activate accessibility services.	1
If an unsuspecting user grants these permissions (see Figure 4), the trojan can read any text displayed in any app the user may launch – and send it to the attackers.	1
This means the attackers can steal the victim’s credentials for logging into apps, SMS and email messages, displayed cryptocurrency private keys, and even software-generated 2FA codes.	1
The fact the trojan can steal both the victim’s credentials and also can control their SMS messages and generated 2FA codes means DEFENSOR ID’s operators can bypass two-factor authentication.	1
Our analysis shows the DEFENSOR ID trojan can execute 17 commands received from the attacker-controlled server such as uninstalling an app, launching an app and then performing any click/tap action controlled remotely by the attacker (see Figure 5).	1
In this case, the attacker can get the list of all installed apps and then remotely launch the victim’s app of their choice to either steal credentials or perform malicious actions (e.g.	1
We believe that this is the reason the DEFENSOR ID trojan requests the user to allow “Modify system settings”.	1
Subsequently, the malware will change the screen off time-out to 10 minutes.	1
ESET researchers have detected a new Android malware strain called “DEFENSOR ID” that abuses the Android’s Accessibility Service to perform a host of nefarious actions and give hackers the privilege of notably wiping out the victim’s cryptocurrency wallet or bank account and taking over their email or social media accounts.	1
In May 2020, DEFENSOR ID malware was observed pretending as a security application and claiming to increase user security by using end-to-end encryption.	1
The malware operator dropped all other potentially suspicious features, except one, they asked for the permissions to access the Accessibility Service.	1
In April 2020, Check Point Research found a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) botnet and a dropper for Android devices, dubbed Black Rose Lucy, that primarily leveraged Android’s Accessibility Service using a fake Streaming Video Optimization (SVO) prompt to install their payload without any user interaction.	1
In the same month, Cybereason analyzed a new type of Android mobile banking Trojan named Eventbot, that abused Android’s Accessibility features to steal user data from financial apps, read and steal user SMS messages to allow the malware to bypass two-factor authentication.	1
In March 2020, McAfee Mobile Research team observed an Android malware dubbed Android/LeifAccess.A that abused OAuth leveraging accessibility services to infect Android devices and post fake reviews on Google Play.	1
As was the case with HummingBad, the purpose of HummingWhale is to generate revenue by displaying fraudulent ads and automatically installing apps.	1
When users try to close the ads, the new functionality causes already downloaded apps to run in a virtual machine.	1
HummingWhale has also been observed hiding the original malicious app once it's installed and trying to improve its Google Play reputation by automatically generating posts disguised as positive user comments and ratings.	1
To make matters worse for anyone who may have unknowingly downloaded an affected app, it has much more advanced tools than its predecessor, allowing it to perform ad fraud at an unprecedented scale.	1
A HummingWhale app will provide a user with fake ads that will become particularly harmful to them if opened.	1
“Once the user tries to close the ad, the app, which was already downloaded by the malware, is uploaded to the virtual machine and run as if it is a real device,” Check Point said.	1
The HummingWhale method allows cyber-criminals to have the malware installed through apps without being noticeably suspicious by asking for a number of different permissions.	1
These included the use of certificate pinning and public key encryption for C2 communications, geo-restrictions imposed by the C2 when delivering the second stage, and the comprehensive and well implemented suite of surveillance features.	1
Contacts	1
Audio recordings	1
Videos	1

In addition, the packages offered a feature to perform remote audio recording.	1
“Instances of this spyware were found on the Google Play Store, disguised as service applications from mobile operators,” said researchers in a Friday analysis.	1
They found that it has a variety of nefarious capabilities, including scooping up call logs and SMS messages, Facebook, Gmail and WhatsApp data and conversations, audio-recording the victim and extracting GPS coordinates of the phone.	1
It can also retrieve a list of installed apps, retrieve the device’s browsing history, extract events from the Calendar app and access the owner’s address book.	1
Once the malicious apps are installed, a dropper is first deployed to collect some basic identifying information about the device, including itsmalicious app google play International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code and phone number, and send it to the command-and-control (C2) server (the dropper in some cases purports to be a device check for the fake app).	1
The C2 then sends a ZIP archive, with a collection of files and the primary payload, which includes the bulk of the spyware capabilities.	1
A never-before-publicized mobile spy tool, a mobile surveillanceware remote access trojan (RAT) for Android called Monokle, has been spotted using novel techniques to exfiltrate data.	1
According to the Lookout researchers who discovered Monokle in the wild, the malware has the ability to self-sign trusted certificates to intercept encrypted SSL traffic.	1
It can also record a phone’s lockscreen activity in order to obtain passcodes, and it can leverage accessibility services to gain access to third-party apps.	1
“Among other things, Monokle makes extensive use of the Android accessibility services to exfiltrate data from third party applications and uses predictive-text dictionaries to get a sense of the topics of interest to a target.	1
Monokle will also attempt to record the screen during a screen unlock event so as to compromise a user’s PIN, pattern or password.”	1
On the self-signing front, with root access, Monokle is capable of installing additional attacker-specified certificates to the trusted certificates on an infected device, “effectively opening up the target and the device to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks against TLS traffic,” the researchers wrote.	1
Other functionality includes a cornucopia of classic spyware tricks, such as the ability to harvest contacts and calendar information, record audio and calls, retrieve emails and messages (including from WhatsApp, Skype and more), take photos and videos, track device location and take screenshots.	1
Other features include keylogging, retrieving browsing and call histories, interacting with popular office applications to retrieve document text, making calls and sending text messages, device-fingerprinting, retrieving accounts and associated passwords, and screen recordings.	1
It can also delete arbitrary files and download new ones, reboot a device and execute arbitrary shell code.	1
Monokle, like most advanced threat weapons, appears to be very targeted: It is spreading by way of a very limited set of trojanized applications that contain legitimate functionality to avoid user suspicion.	1
Monokle supports 78 different predefined commands, of which 61 are implemented in recent samples, that allow attackers to exfiltrate requested data.	1

The surveillance software abuses Android accessibility services to capture data from third party apps, including Google Docs, Facebook messenger, VK, Whatsapp, WeChat, Viber, Skype, and Snapchat.	1
The malicious code, in fact, is able to read text notifications displayed on a device’s screen.	1
The surveillance surveillance also uses user-defined predictive-text dictionaries to “get a sense of the topics of interest to a target,” it also attempts to record the phone screen during a screen unlock event in order to obtain the phone’s PIN, pattern or password.	1
If root access is available on the target device, the spyware installs attacker-specified root CA certificates to the trusted certificates on an infected device that would attackers to carry out man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.	1
This Android malware can take photos and videos and spy on your app history	1
A highly-targeted, custom-built form of powerful Android malware is being deployed to conduct surveillance on selected individuals, according to security researchers.	1
These include keylogging, taking photos and videos, retrieving history of apps including web browsers, social media services, and messengers, tracking the location of the user, and much more.	1
In addition, Monokle has the ability to install trusted certificates which allow it to gain root access to the device.	1
Much of this is achieved by exploiting accessibility services and tailoring them to steal data from third-party applications, as well as using the predictive-text dictionaries of the user to gain insight into the kinds of topic that interest them.	1
The malware can also record the screen when it is being unlocked in order to reveal the victim's passcode.	1
It's still uncertain how Monokle is distributed, but researchers note that some samples of the malware are built around trojanized versions of real applications, complete with the same appearance and functionality -- and that phishing could play a part in delivery.	1
"""In similar attacks, such as Dark Caracal, we've observed the use of phishing attacks through messaging applications, SMS, or emails used to distribute this type of malware,"" said Bauer."	1
Meet Monokle, an Android Malware Family Capable of Stealing and Changing Passwords	1
Monokle can, among other things, log keystrokes, delete and download files, send messages, exfiltrate contacts, device information, emails, login data, lists of installed apps, and call and browsing histories.	1
It can also take photos, videos, and screenshots, and if it has root access, it can execute commands.	1
It uses Android's accessibility services to capture and exfiltrate information from Microsoft Office and Google Docs files as well as instant messaging applications like Whatsapp, Viber, Snapchat, etc.	1
It can make screen recordings even when the device is still locked, which means that it can capture the password, PIN code, or pattern used to unlock the device.	1
As with most Android malware families, the primary infection vector comes in the form of trojanized apps distributed on third-party app stores.	1
Most of them impersonate real applications, and some even come with legitimate functionality, which can make detection more difficult.	1
The analysis of the APK was rather interesting, because some of the actions were very common spyware features, such as the exfiltration of SMS messages, call logs and other data.	1
However, in addition to the traditional functionality, there were also backdoor capabilities such as upload, download, delete files, camera takeover and record surrounding audio.	1
The malware uses HTTP for communication with the C2 server for command handling and data exfiltration.	1
1 reqsmscal.php Send specified SMS message	1
2 reqsmscal.php Call specified number	1
3 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate device info, such as phone model and OS version	1
4 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate a list of all installed applications	1
5 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate default browser history (limited to a given date)	1
6 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate Chrome browser history (limited to a given date)	1
7 reqsmscal.php Exfiltrate memory card file structure	1
8 reqsmscal.php Record surrounding sound for 80 seconds	1
1 reqcalllog.php Exfiltrate all call logs	1
2 reqcalllog.php Exfiltrate all SMS messages	1
3 reqcalllog.php Upload specified file from the device to the C2	1
4 reqcalllog.php Download file from specified URL and save on device	1
5 reqcalllog.php Delete specified file	1
9 reqcalllog.php Take photo (muted audio) with rear camera, send to C2	1
10 reqcalllog.php Take photo (muted audio) with front camera, send to C2	1
With this modification, an application sends device location coordinates with every message.	1
Found bundled with a repackaged app, the spyware’s surveillance capabilities involve hiding its presence on the device, recording phone calls, logging incoming text messages, recoding videos, taking pictures and collecting GPS coordinates, then broadcasting all of that to an attacker-controlled C&C (command and control) server.	1
Records every phone call (literally the conversation as a media file), then sends it together with the caller id to the C&C (incall3.php and outcall3.php)	1
Logs every incoming SMS message (SMS body and SMS sender) to C&C (script3.php)	1
Can send all call logs (“content://call_log/calls”, info: callname, callnum, calldate, calltype, callduration) to C&C (calllog.php)	1
Whenever the user snaps a picture, either with the front or rear camera, it gets sent to the C&C (uppc.php, fi npic.php orreqpic.php)	1
Can send GPS coordinates to C&C (gps3.php)	1
Attackers aim to backdoor legitimate applications with an unusual injection technique dubbed Smali.	1
The mobile malware also aims to inject legitimate mobile applications with a backdoor for persistent access once it has compromised an Android device.	1
The ViceLeaker APK implements very common spyware features (exfiltration of SMS messages, call logs, and device information) along with backdoor capabilities (upload, download, delete files, camera takeover, and record surrounding audio).	1
During the investigation, Kaspersky also spotted a sample of a modified version of the open-source Jabber/XMPP called “Conversations.” The tainted version used by the ViceLeaker group sends the C2 geographical coordinates every time a message was sent via the app.	1
The malware is designed to steal sensitive information, including call recordings, text messages, photos, videos, and location data without users’ knowledge.	1
Apart from spying features, the malware also has backdoor capabilities, including upload, download, delete files, record surrounding audio, takeover camera, and make calls or send messages to specific numbers, according to the researchers.	1
The researchers said that attackers used Smali injection technique, that allows hackers to disassemble the code of an original application and add malicious code.	1
ViceLeaker Android malware steals call recordings, photos, videos & texts	1
Researchers then tagged a sample of their own to inspect further and discovered that the APK’s inner functionalities included launching a malicious payload, which was already embedded in the APK’s original coding.	1
To disassemble the original application’s code and add the malicious one, attackers have used the Smali injection technique.	1
The report reveals that the malware can steal call recordings, photos, videos, text messages, and location data without alerting the user.	1
Furthermore, what’s worse is that the malware is also equipped with backdoor capabilities such as it can upload/download/delete files, control the camera and record audio files, initiate calls and send out text messages to certain numbers.	1
Recently, Palo Alto Networks researchers discovered an advanced Android malware we’ve named “SpyDealer” which exfiltrates private data from more than 40 apps and steals sensitive messages from communication apps by abusing the Android accessibility service feature.	1
SpyDealer uses exploits from a commercial rooting app to gain root privilege, which enables the subsequent data theft.	1
Exfiltrate private data from more than 40 popular apps including: WeChat, Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, Line, Viber, QQ, Tango, Telegram, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo, Android Native Browser, Firefox Browser, Oupeng Brower, QQ Mail, NetEase Mail, Taobao, and Baidu Net Disk	1
Abuses the Android Accessibility Service feature to steal sensitive messages from popular communication and social apps such as WeChat, Skype, Viber, QQ	1
Takes advantage of the commercial rooting app “Baidu Easy Root” to gain root privilege and maintain persistence on the compromised device	1
Harvests an exhaustive list of personal information including phone number, IMEI, IMSI, SMS, MMS, contacts, accounts, phone call history, location, and connected Wi-Fi information	1
Automatically answer incoming phone calls from a specific number	1
Remote control of the device via UDP, TCP and SMS channels	1
Spy on the compromised user by:	1
Recording the phone call and the surrounding audio & video.	1
Taking photos via both the front and rear camera	1
Monitoring the compromised device’s location	1
Taking screenshots	1
We do not know exactly how devices are initially infected with SpyDealer, but have seen evidence to suggest Chinese users becoming infected through compromised wireless networks.	1
Starting from 1.9.3, content of configuration files and almost all constant strings in the code are encrypted or encoded.	1
An accessibility service was also introduced in 1.9.3 to steal targeted apps’ messages.	1
After installed on an Android device, SpyDealer shows no application icon.	1
However, it registers two broadcast receivers to listen for events related to the device booting up and network connection status.	1
At the first launch, it retrieves configuration information from the local asset file named readme.txt.	1
1 Get call history 9 Send recorded audio files	1
2 Get SMS messages 10 Capture screenshot	1
3 Record audio 11 List files under a given directory	1
4 Get GSM location 12 Get GPS location	1
5 Get contacts 20 Intercept incoming SMS messages	1
7 Get information and network traffic of installed apps 21 Do not intercept incoming SMS messages	1
8 Get device specific information 82 Get current running apps	1
SpyDealer uses two different rooting procedures to gain root (superuser) privilege.	1
Previously in 2015, we saw the Rootnik Android Trojan abuse the “Root Assistant” tool to gain root access.	1
After gaining root privilege, SpyDealer takes steps to maintain persistence on the compromised device.	1
SpyDealer is capable of receiving commands from remote servers via a number of different channels by either actively initiating connections to C2 servers or passively receiving instructions from C2 servers.	1
SpyDealer registers a broadcast receiver with a higher priority than the default messaging app to listen for the commands via incoming SMS messages.	1
1 Get geographical location via GSM cell information.	1
2 Collect the contacts on the device and send back via SMS.	1
3 Gather SMS messages which are created later than a given date in the inbox, outbox and draft box, and then send back via SMS.	1
4 Exfiltrate call histories that are later than a given date through SMS.	1
5 Set the auto reply phone number.	1
The malware will automatically answer the incoming phone call when the number is the same as the set one.	1
It first collects the GSM cell identity, area code and network operator and then posts the encoded data to the Baidu map service to retrieve the geographical location.	1
With this tactic, a compromised device’s location is exposed to the attacker even there is no GPS available.	1
Besides the commands listed above, SpyDealer can also set the remote server’s IP address under the following two conditions:	1
SpyDealer creates a TCP server on the compromised device listening at port 39568 and waits for incoming commands.	1
imei Send back the device IMEI	1
mobileinfor Send back device information including IMEI, IMSI and phone number	1
gettype\t1 Send back contacts information including contact name and phone number	1
gettype\t\t1 Send back SMS messages in inbox, outbox and draft box	1
gettype\t\t\t1 Send back call histories including phone call duration, type and date	1
listdir\t<directory> Send back the information of files under a given directory.	1
Aside from the TCP server that passively waits for the commands, SpyDealer can also actively connect to the remote server with the configured IP address to ask for commands through UDP or TCP.	1
To achieve this effect in newer Android versions, SpyDealer first inserts an SMS message into the inbox and then posts a notification indicating an SMS message has arrived.	1
To our knowledge, this is the first malware family that fakes an incoming SMS message in this way.	1
The data sent back to the remote server is encrypted using TEA algorithm.	1
To mitigate this risk, SpyDealer creates an effective session layer on top of UDP.	1
SpyDealer divides the original data into multiple groups and each group has no more than 1000 bytes data.	1
Private Data Collection	1
As discussed in section Command & Control, we have seen this malware employ many mechanisms to collect private data.	1
Additionally, with root privilege, SpyDealer also tries to gather data from more than 40 common apps falling in different categories including social, communication, browser, mobile mail client, etc.	1
Accessibility Service Abuse	1
To avoid this obstacle, starting in version 1.9.3, SpyDealer implemented an extra accessibility service to steal plain messages by directly extracting texts from the screen.	1
RuMMS: The Latest Family of Android Malware Attacking Users in Russia Via SMS Phishing	1
To lure the victims to download the malware, threat actors use SMS phishing – sending a short SMS message containing a malicious URL to the potential victims.	1
After landing on the victim’s phone, the RuMMS apps will request device administrator privileges, remove their icons to hide themselves from users, and remain running in the background to perform a series of malicious behaviors.	1
●      Sending device information to a remote command and control (C2) server.	1
●      Contacting the C2 server for instructions.	1
Sending SMS messages to financial institutions to query account balances.	1
Uploading any incoming SMS messages (including the balance inquiry results) to the remote C2 server.	1
Sending C2-specified SMS messages to phone numbers in the victim’s contacts.	1
Forward incoming phone calls to intercept voice-based two-factor authentication.	1
Smishing: The Major Way To Distribute RuMMS	1
Smishing (SMS phishing) is currently the primary way threat actors are distributing the malware.	1
The process starts when an SMS phishing message arrives at a user’s phone.	1
It first starts another activity defined in “org.starsizew.Aa” to request device administrator privileges, and then calls the following API of “android.content.pm.PackageManager” (the Android package manager to remove its own icon on the home screen in order to conceal the existence of RuMMS from the user:	1
At the same time, ”org.starsizew.MainActivity” will start the main service as defined in “org.starsizew.Tb”, and use a few mechanisms to keep the main service running continuously in the background.	1
Other than that, its major functionality is to collect private device information, upload it to a remote C2 server, and handle any commands as requested by the C2 server.	1
The first type of content, starting with “method=install”, will be sent when the app is started for the first time, including the following device private information:	1
The third type of information will be sent when RuMMS intercepts any SMS messages, including the balance inquiry results when it contacts the SMS code of a particular financial service.	1
Method onPostExecute parses the response from the above HTTP session and executes the commands provided by the remote attacker.	1
install_true: to modify app preference to indicate that the C2 server received the victim device’s status.	1
sms_send: to send C2-specified SMS messages to C2-specified recipients.	1
sms_grab: to upload periodically the SMS messages in the inbox to C2 server.	1
delivery: to deliver specified text to all victim’s contacts (SMS worming).	1
call_number: to forward phone calls to intercept voice based two-factor authentication.	1
new_url: to change the URL of the C2 server in the app preference.	1
ussd: to call a C2-specified phone number.	1
During our investigation, we observed the C2 server sending multiple “balance” commands to different institutions, presumably to query the victim’s financial account balances.	1
RuMMS can upload responses to the balance inquiries (received via SMS message) to the remote C2 server, which can send back additional commands to be sent from the victim to the provider’s payment service.	1
These could include resetting the user’s PIN, enabling or disabling various alerts and confirmations, and confirming the user’s identity.	1
In total we captured 297 RuMMS samples, all of which attempt to contact an initial C2 server that we extracted from the app package.	1
Smishing (SMS phishing) offers a unique vector to infect mobile users.	1
The recent RuMMS campaign shows that Smishing is still a popular means for threat actors to distribute their malware.	1
The malware disguises itself as Сooбщениe, which translated to english means Messages, and performs its malicious functionality by exploiting Android AccessibilityService, which assists those with disabilities in using Android devices and apps.	1
It then hides itself in order to spy on its victims.	1
Enabling AccessibilityService	1
Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below).	1
Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService.	1
Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen.	1
If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service.	1
Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app.	1
Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server.	1
"We noticed that command ""40"" was used for disabling the apps."	1
In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: 	1
As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it.	1
SMS: Sending and stealing	1
"As in the case below, we found that command number ""11"" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C"	1
Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device.	1
This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information.	1
Stealing Contacts	1
The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device.	1
We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing).	1
The malware also has calling functionality.	1
New Android Malware RuMMS Targeting Users through Smishing	1
The malware is distributed via a series of infected subdomains that are actually registered with an authentic domain name, which is owned by a popular shared hosting service provider based in Russia.	1
The victims are attracted to download the malicious code of the malware through SMS phishing campaign in which a short SMS message is sent to the victims.	1
When the malware is able to infect the device of the victim, the malware’s app asks for administrator privileges and will delete all the icons that belong to the app so that the victim doesn’t detect it.	1
* Sending out information about the device to a remotely controlled C2 server	1
* Communicating with the C2 server for new instructions	1
* Sending SMS messages to financial institutions for inquiring about the victim’s account balances	1
* Transferring the acquired information about account balances to the C2 server	1
* Spreading the infection to other numbers present in the contacts folder of the victim’s phone through sending C2-specified SMS messages	1
FireEye’s investigators emulated an already infected Android device to communicate with the C2 server of the RuMMS malware and they identified that the C2 server instructed their device to send out four different SMS messages to four unique numbers.	1
Three out of the four messages were aimed at checking out the account balance of the user at that particular institution.	1
Once Chrysaor is installed, a remote operator is able to surveil the victim's activities on the device and within the vicinity, leveraging microphone, camera, data collection, and logging and tracking application activities on communication apps such as phone and SMS.	1
ade8bef0ac29fa363fc9afd958af0074478aef650adeb0318517b48bd996d5d5Upon installation, the app uses known framaroot exploits to escalate privileges and break Android's application sandbox.	1
If the targeted device is not vulnerable to these exploits, then the app attempts to use a superuser binary pre-positioned at /system/csk to elevate privileges.	1
After escalating privileges, the app immediately protects itself and starts to collect data, by:	1
Installing itself on the /system partition to persist across factory resets	1
Removing Samsung's system update app (com.sec.android.fotaclient) and disabling auto-updates to maintain persistence (sets Settings.System.SOFTWARE_UPDATE_AUTO_UPDATE to 0)	1
Deleting WAP push messages and changing WAP message settings, possibly for anti-forensic purpose.	1
Starting content observers and the main task loop to receive remote commands and exfiltrate data	1
Repeated commands: use alarms to periodically repeat actions on the device to expose data, including gathering location data.	1
Data collectors are used in conjunction with repeated commands to collect user data including, SMS settings, SMS messages, Call logs, Browser History, Calendar, Contacts, Emails, and messages from selected messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, Kakoa, Viber, and Skype by making /data/data directories of the apps world readable.	1
Content observers: use Android's ContentObserver framework to gather changes in SMS, Calendar, Contacts, Cell info, Email, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Kakao, Viber, and Skype.	1
Screenshots: captures an image of the current screen via the raw frame buffer.	1
Keylogging: record input events by hooking IPCThreadState::Transact from /system/lib/libbinder.so, and intercepting android::parcel with the interface com.android.internal.view.IInputContext.	1
RoomTap: silently answers a telephone call and stays connected in the background, allowing the caller to hear conversations within the range of the phone's microphone.	1
If the user unlocks their device, they will see a black screen while the app drops the call, resets call settings and prepares for the user to interact with the device normally.	1
Finally, the app can remove itself through three ways:	1
There actually is malware in the wild that targets iOS users — it’s been proved a number of times, and in August 2016 researchers proved it again by revealing the existence of Pegasus, spyware capable of hacking any iPad or iPhone, harvesting data about the victim, and establishing surveillance on them.	1
After scanning the target’s device, it installs the necessary modules to read the user’s messages and mail, listen to calls, capture screenshots, log pressed keys, exfiltrate browser history, contacts, and so on and so forth.	1
Basically, it can spy on every aspect of the target’s life.	1
It’s also noteworthy that Pegasus could even listen to encrypted audio streams and read encrypted messages — thanks to its keylogging and audio recording capabilities, it was stealing messages before they were encrypted (and, for incoming messages, after decryption).	1
Another interesting fact about Pegasus is that it tries to hide itself really diligently.	1
The malware self-destructs if it is not able to communicate with its command-and-control (C&C) server for more than 60 days, or if it detects that it was installed on the wrong device with the wrong SIM card (remember, this is targeted spying; NSO’s clients weren’t going after random victims).	1
Another difference: If iOS version fails to jailbreak the device, the whole attack fails, but with the Android version, even if the malware fails to obtain the necessary root access to install surveillance software, it will still try directly asking the user for the permissions it needs to exfiltrate at least some data.	1
Like the iPhone version, the Android Pegasus had some advanced features: it could be controlled via SMS and self-destruct if required.	1
"The ""highly advanced"" tool was also able to grab large amounts of comms data, pilfering messages and call records from WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Skype and Gmail, amongst others, Lookout noted in its report released Monday."	1
It could also control the camera and microphone, as well as carry out keylogging and take screenshots.	1
"The ""suicide"" self-destruct feature was particularly devilish, helping NSO Group's malware avoid detection for almost three years."	1
One of the samples, aimed at Samsung phones, removed the manufacturer's system update app to prevent security fixes from disrupting its snooping.	1
Pegasus is generally spread through a specially crafted exploit link (via phishing techniques) which when clicked delivers a chain of zero-day exploits to penetrate security features on the phone.	1
On infected devices, Pegasus is a powerful spyware that can do many things, such as record conversations, steal private messages, exfiltrate photos, and much much more.	1
Report: NSO Group's Pegasus Spyware Can Break Into Cloud Services, Transmit User Data to Server	1
Israeli spyware company NSO Group’s powerful Pegasus malware—the same spyware implicated in a breach of WhatsApp earlier this year—is capable of scraping a target’s data from the servers of Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft, according to a report in the Financial Times on Friday.	1
According to the Times, “people familiar with its sales pitch” as well as leaked sales documents show that NSO Group’s parent company Q-Cyber is advertising Pegasus as having the capability to copy authentication keys to services including Google Drive, Facebook Messenger, and iCloud from an infected phone to a web server that is then capable of independently downloading the target’s entire online history.	1
It works on any device that Pegasus can infect, including many of the latest iPhones and Android smartphones, according to the documents, and allows ongoing access to data uploaded to the cloud from laptops, tablets and phones—even if Pegasus is removed from the initially targeted smartphone.	1
One pitch document from NSO’s parent company, Q-Cyber, which was prepared for the government of Uganda earlier this year, advertised the ability of Pegasus to “retrieve the keys that open cloud vaults” and “independently sync-and-extract data”.	1
The latest version of the Pegasus implant has a number of capabilities, according to Citizen Lab, including: Recording audio from the microphone including both ambient “hot mic” recording and audio of encrypted phone calls; taking pictures; tracking device location; and accessing passwords and stored credentials.	1
The spyware, called Pegasus and developed by the Israeli company NSO Group, is reportedly instrumental to several governments’ oppressive surveillance campaigns against their own citizens and residents, and, while NSO Group has repeatedly denied allegations that it complicitly sells Pegasus to human right abusers, it is difficult to reconcile exactly how the zero-click spyware program—which non-consensually and invisibly steals emails, text messages, photos, videos, locations, passwords, and social media activity—is at the same time a tool that can, in its very use, respect the rights of those around the world to speak freely, associate safely, and live privately.	1
"Dubbed ""Pegasus,"" the assault package leverages three zero-day vulnerabilities to remotely jailbreak and install a suite of monitoring software onto a victim's device."	1
Once installed, Pegasus exploits kernel flaws to upgrade privileges, allowing attackers to intercept text messages, pilfer emails, access contacts and steal information from a variety of third-party apps including Gmail, Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, WeChat and more.	1
A “cyber arms dealer” named NSO Group developed the Pegasus malware, which jailbreaks or roots target devices to surveil specific targets.	1

Live audio capture	1
Remote control of the malware via SMS	1
Messaging data exfiltration from common applications including WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Viber, Kakao	1
Browser history exfiltration	1
Email exfiltration from Android’s Native Email client	1
Contacts and text message	1
It self-destructs if the software feels its position is at risk.	1
The biggest distinction between the iOS and Android versions of Pegasus is the Android version does not use zero-day vulnerabilities to root the device.	1
In the course of researching the Pegasus for iOS, Lookout discovered three vulnerabilities Pegasus used to jailbreak the target device, and install and run the malicious software.	1
In the Android version, however, the attackers built in functionality that would allow Pegasus for Android to still ask for permissions that would then allow it to access and exfiltrate data.	1
The company’s flagship product is Pegasus, spyware that can stealthily enter a smartphone and gain access to everything on it, including its camera and microphone.	1
Earlier version of Pegasus were installed on smartphones through vulnerabilities in commonly used apps or by spear-phishing, which involves tricking a targeted user into clicking a link or opening a document that secretly installs the software.	1
It can also be installed over a wireless transceiver located near a target, or manually if an agent can steal the target’s phone.	1
Pegasus can infiltrate a smartphone via the widely used messaging app WhatsApp without the phone’s user noticing.	1
Since 2019, Pegasus users have been able to install the software on smartphones with a missed call on WhatsApp, and can even delete the record of the missed call, making it impossible for the the phone’s owner to know anything is amiss.	1
Another way is by simply sending a message to a user’s phone that produces no notification.	1
Once installed, Pegasus can theoretically harvest any data from the device and transmit it back to the attacker.	1
It can steal photos and videos, recordings, location records, communications, web searches, passwords, call logs and social media posts.	1
It also has the capability to activate cameras and microphones for real-time surveillance without the permission or knowledge of the user.	1
A new strain of mobile malware found on an array of apps can pull out sensitive data – including audio recordings – from Android phones.	1
A sophisticated strain of mobile malware targeting Android devices can extract sensitive data and audio recordings, run up premium SMS charges and then tries to extort money from victims.	1
Once the RedDrop-infected apps are installed the program silently downloads an additional seven Android application packages (APK) that add additional spyware and malicious components such as trojans, premium SMS functionality and additional dropper software.	1
“When the user interacts with the app, each interaction secretly triggers the sending of an SMS to a premium service, which is then instantly deleted before it can be detected,” the company said.	1
The rogue apps are capable of  harvesting sensitive data, including passively recording audio of the device’s surroundings, accessing photos, contacts, and extracting locally saved files.	1
Data siphoned off phones are uploaded to the attacker’s Dropbox account to be used in conjunction with further attacks and for possible extortion purposes.	1
“Apps within the RedDrop family request invasive permissions enabling the attack to be conducted without requesting further interaction from the user,” according to Wandera.	1
“One of the more destructive permissions allows the malware to be persistent between reboots.	1
Granting it the ability to constantly communicate with command and control (C2) servers, permitting the covert activation of its malicious functionality.”	1
Creepy New Android Malware Can Secretly Record Your Conversations	1
Instead, RedDrop wants to steal all the information it can from your phone... just in case, there's something juicy in there that its creators can use against you.	1
Researchers at U.K.-based Wandera say that RedDrop targets sensitive data like your contacts and photos.	1
It also gathers information about your phone, from the apps you have installed to the WiFi networks you're near.	1
The most frightening thing about RedDrop, however, is that it can hijack your phone's microphone.	1
That allows it to eavesdrop on conversations you -- or anyone else -- might be having near the infected device.	1
It racks up charges by stealthily communicating with a premium-rate SMS system.	1

As we'll find out in a minute, Monokle is an extremely sophisticated and versatile piece of mobile surveillanceware, and because such malicious apps are usually developed by people who know what they're doing, often, attributing them to a specific group of hackers is next to impossible.	0
The malicious capabilities observed in the second stage include the following:	0
"The spyware came to light after pro-democracy activist Ahmed Mansoor received two text messages promising ""secrets"" about prisoners tortured in United Arab Emirates jails."	0
To avoid threats like TangleBot, mobile users should practice safe messaging practices and avoid clicking on any links in texts, even if they appear to come from a legitimate contact, researchers noted.	0
These exploits still plague many devices today because security patches that fix them may not be available for some versions of Android, or the patches were never installed by the user.	0
Some of the more interesting commands include:	0
If there is no such file, the malware will download it from http[:]//yangxiu2014.0323.utnvg[.]com/apk/raw.zip.	0

The result has been an immediate rise in mobile application infections and attempts to steal money from consumers in Russia and across Europe, as more and more cybercriminals acquire the malware for free.	0
It is also much harder for network defenders or researchers to track a campaign where the infrastructure is a moving target.	0
The output from the previous function is passed to the RC4 cipher.	0
Just to be clear, the action does not appear to have seen computer crime investigators hunting and apprehending the authors of DroidJack, but instead taking a long hard look at the people who had purchased the software and used it to spy upon others.	0
We strongly recommend all financial institutions to understand their current and future threat exposure and consequently implement the relevant detection and control mechanisms.	0
