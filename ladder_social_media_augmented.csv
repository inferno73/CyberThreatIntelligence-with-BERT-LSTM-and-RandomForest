Poor metabolic health can accelerate aging processes like inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction: Chronic high blood sugar acts like a continuous false alarm, leading to chronic inflammation. High sugar levels produce more free radicals, causing oxidative stress. Remember, these are like rust that erodes metal over time. Overcharged cells from excess glucose wear out our cellular powerhouses, the mitochondria. The result?

Its a period of time that is so influential in todays mainstream music and fashion worlds. To create that authentic feel I teamed up with Dubai based fashion designer to customize a handmade 70s outfit with all the materials and accessories coming from Deira. For the music I worked with internationally renowned DJ & Producer, , to digitally remaster a vinyl track from the 70s to give the video that feel good disco vibe. I love coming up with original ideas and doing things a little different. As the UAE was founded in 1971 I thought it would be fun to take a trip to the future! The challenge was to create something unique, shot only on iPhone, that would juxtapose a retro vibe with a futuristic setting.

The complex conflict followed the end of colonialism and the eruption of independence in DRC in the 1960s. Mining has played a large role in supplying finance to several rebel groups operating in DRC, causing gross damage, millions of deaths, and displacements of the people living here. Please DONATE to CKI: Congo Kids Initiative (CKI) is specifically for children who have lost their parents and communities to the conflict. St. Kizito is a facility located in the town of Bunia at the site of some of the most extreme violence. They work with local partners that determine targets of how these children can be provided with the most loving, sustainable, and nurturing environment.

After his untimely death, he was buried at his wifes request on the land that gave rise to his enduring legacy. He was famous for a great many things, but what always stood out to me was his courage and commitment in successfully saving his stranded crew during the ill-fated expedition of 1916. Today on February 15th, we celebrate his 150th birthday. May his story continue to inspire us and remind us of the beauty of the last continent. #shackleton #adventure #antarctica",0

"Do you recognize this island? Its probably the most recognizable Slovenian landmark and yet from my friends who love the country, I know its far from the only thing to enjoy in Still with my one afternoon ashore in the country as part of our hosted I wanted to visit understand why its so famous! It was a 2 hour bus ride from the port of Koper and after arriving we took traditional Pletna boats to the island in the alpine lake that doesnt allow motored craft and was once home to a temple to Ziva [the Slavic goddess of love and fertility] I fell hard for these gleaming wooden boats with awnings that are compared to Venetian gondolas, passed down through the families that captain them. Theyre controlled using two long wooden poles and to do so is to be called a Pletnarstvo. On the island: visit the Church of the Assumption whose current Baroque design dates to the 17th century with a chapel from the year 1004. Ring the bell from the 1500s to make your wish come true. Then climb the tower for views across the tiled roof to Bled Castle. Before departing, get gelato at Caf Potinica. Youll earn it once youve climbed the 99 steps from the boat launch and walked all the way up the 52-meter high tower! So what makes it all so special that its one of the most photographed spots in the world? I still dont know. But it is a charming area! And the lake is so beautiful when the sun is shining and that alpine water gleams turquoise and green. Plus the excursion did make me want to return to see much more of Slovenia!

"SAVE this for a quick Egg Free Breakfast option! Rell has never liked eggs- never. Which led us to exploring if there was something instinctual behind it and we learned she had an egg allergy when she was a baby. The great news is, she can eat eggs baked into things, and I think shes growing out of this allergy BUT she still dislikes eggs. Obviously eggs are an easy and awesome way for quick protein for breakfast especially in the form of egg bites! SO it was time to explore a new Quick Protein option for breakfast and she LOVES these Sausage bites! We call them muffins Wether youre catering to an egg allergy in your home or not- this is a great breakfast alternative to keep in your fridge or freezer for when you need a quick and healthy breakfast grab! *I make these gluten free- and they can easily be made dairy free! RECIPE -1lb ground Breakfast Sausage -1-2 cups finely chopped broccoli florets (optional, but a great way to add greens into breakfast!) -1 cup your choice of gluten free flour (I used Bobs Red Mill Paleo All Purpose mix) -1 tsp baking powder -1 cup shredded cheese- I use goat cheddar. You can simply make this dairy free with a dairy free cheese alternative! -3/4 cup Almond Milk (or your choice of milk) Saut 1 lb breakfast sausage & finely chopped broccoli florets in avocado oil until sausage is fully cooked In a mixing bowl, add 1 cup gluten free flour, 1 tsp baking powder, & mix together. Then add 1 cup shredded cheese. Mix all together. Add and mix in cooked sausage & broccoli to the dry mix. Add 3/4 cup of Almond Milk. Mix together well. Scoop mixture into pre-greased cupcake pan- I use avocado oil spray. Bake for 20-25 minutes at 400 degrees. Enjoy these!! You can store in the fridge for a few days, or freeze them for when needed! Approved by my toddler and my husband and I love them too! #eggfreebreakfast #glutenfree #toddlerbreakfast #glutenfreebreakfast",0

"Americans sure loved their spirits, and that love affair birthed the infamous sin taxes we know today, levied on our beloved alcohol and tobacco. Even the great President George Washington was skeptical of this tax, but after touring Virginia and Pennsylvania in 1791, he found local elected officials toasting to the idea of a whiskey tax. With newfound conviction, he returned to Philadelphia, championing the legislation. Its interesting to note that in those times, a whopping 96 percent of the American population resided east of the Appalachian Mountains, the very folks the whiskey tax targeted. Meanwhile, the remaining 4 percent lived west of the Appalachians, in what was then known as the West, where corn was king and distilling whiskey was just part of the subsistence lifestyle. And thus, the sin tax saga began. Check out this full podcast episode on Everything Everywhere Daily on all platforms, podcast is in the bio. #americanhistory #whiskeytax #georgewashington",0

I have had adventures and experiences beyond human imagination, and I am only beginning to share what Ive seen. Stay tuned as I tell my story.",0

Below you will find my tip for staying hydrated and a trick on how to make water taste yummy! Infused watermelon and basil water The flavor is a water melony with a hint of basil, but, the scent of the basil as you drink it is intoxicating. Scrunch the basil in your hands before adding to the water to increase the flavor. Give it at least 2 hours in the fridge to soak up the flavor. I like to let all infused water sit at least 2 hours but not more than two days before drinking. You can make little waters like this or make one big jug to finish that day.Try to use organic produce and wash everything thoroughly. Get that water in people!
